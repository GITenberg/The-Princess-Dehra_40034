<h1>THE PRINCESS DEHRA</h1>
<h2 id="c1">I
<br /><span class="small">THE RECALL</span></h2>
<p>For the first time in a generation the Castle of
Lotzen was entertaining its lord. He had come suddenly,
a month before, and presently there had
followed rumors of strange happenings in Dornlitz,
in which the Duke had been too intimately concerned
to please the King, and as punishment had been
banished to his mountain estates. But Lotzenia
was far from the Capital and isolated, and the
people cared more for their crops and the amount
of the tax levy than for the doings of the Court.
And so it concerned them very little why the red
banner with the golden cross floated from the highest
turret of the old pile of stone, on the spur of the
mountain overhanging the foaming Dreer. They
knew it meant the Duke himself was in presence;
but to them there was but one over-lord: the Dalberg,
who reigned in Dornlitz; and in him they had
all pride&mdash;for was not the Dalberg their hereditary
chieftain centuries before he was the King!</p>
<p>True, the Duke of Lotzen had long been the Heir
Presumptive, and so, in the prospective, entitled to
their loyalty, but lately there had come from across
the Sea a new Dalberg, of the blood of the great
Henry, who, it was said, had displaced him in the
line of Succession, and was to marry the Princess
Dehra.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>And at her name every woman of them curtsied
and every man uncovered; blaming High Heaven
the while, that she might not reign over them, when
Frederick the King were gone; and well prepared
to welcome the new heir if she were to be his queen.</p>
<p>At first the Duke had kept to the seclusion of his
own domain, wide and wild enough to let him ride
all day without crossing its boundary, but after a
time he came at intervals, with a companion or two,
into the low-lands, choosing the main highways, and
dallying occasionally at some cross-road smithy for
a word of gossip with those around the forge.</p>
<p>For Lotzen was not alone in his exile; he might
be banished from the Capital, but that was no reason for
denying himself all its pleasures; and the lights
burned late at the Castle, and when the wind was
from the North it strewed the valley with whisps of
music and strands of laughter. And the country-side
shook its head, and marveled at the turning of
night into day, and at people who seemed never
to sleep except when others worked; and not much
even then, if the tales of such of the servants as
belonged to the locality were to be believed.</p>
<p>And the revelry waxed louder and wilder as the
days passed, and many times toward evening the
whole company would come plunging down the
mountain, and, with the great dogs baying before
them, go racing through the valleys and back again
to the Castle, as though some fiend were hot on their
trail or they on his.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>And ever beside the Duke, on a great, black
horse, went the same woman, slender and sinuous,
with raven hair and dead-white cheek; a feather
touch on rein, a careless grace in saddle. And as
they rode the Duke watched her with glowing eyes;
and his cold face warmed with his thoughts, and
he would speak to her earnestly and persuasively;
and she, swaying toward him, would answer softly
and with a tantalizing smile.</p>
<p>Then, one day, she had refused to ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am tired,&rdquo; she said, when at the sounding of
the horn he had sought her apartments; &ldquo;let the
others go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went over and leaned on the back of her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired&mdash;of what?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of everything&mdash;of myself most of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of everybody?&rdquo; smiling down at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One usually tires of self last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want to leave me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;No, not you, Ferdinand&mdash;the
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I send them away?&rdquo; he said eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And make this lonely place more lonely still!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I despise the miserable place,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not to Paris to-night?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, indeed?&rdquo; he answered, gravely, &ldquo;for
the others and&mdash;you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you, too?&rdquo; glancing up at him and touching,
for an instant, his hand.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;You forget, there
is a King in Dornlitz!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would go <i>incog.</i> and old Frederick never
be the wiser, nor care even if he were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed shortly. &ldquo;Think you so, <i>ma belle</i>,&mdash;well,
believe me, I want not to be the one to try
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horn rang out again from the court-yard;
the Duke crossed to a window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;we will follow presently;&rdquo;
and with a clatter and a shout, they spurred across
the bridge and away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who leads?&rdquo; she asked, going over and drawing
herself up on the casement.</p>
<p>He put his arm around her. &ldquo;What matters,&rdquo;
he laughed, &ldquo;since we are here?&rdquo; and bent his head
to her cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go to Paris, dear,&rdquo; she whispered,
caressingly; &ldquo;to the boulevards and the music, the
life, and the color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you
ask, little one&mdash;once I might have dared it, but not
now&mdash;no, not now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew a bit nearer. &ldquo;And would the penalty
now be so very serious?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>He looked at her a while uncertainly; and she
smiled back persuasively. She knew that he was in
disfavor because of his plots against the Archduke
Armand&rsquo;s honor and life; and that he had been sent
hither in disgrace; but all along what had puzzled
her was his calm acquiescence; his remaining in this
desolation, with never a word of anger toward the
King, nor disposition to slip away surreptitiously to
haunts beyond the border. Why should he be so
careful not to transgress even the spirit of the royal
order?&mdash;he who had not hesitated to play a false
wife against the Archduke Armand, to try assassination,
and to arrange deliberately to kill him in a
duel. She remembered well that evening in her
reception room, at the Hotel Metzen in Dornlitz,
when Lotzen&rsquo;s whole scheme had suddenly collapsed
like a house of cards. She recalled the
King&rsquo;s very words of sentence when, at last,
he had deigned to notice the Duke. &ldquo;The Court
has no present need of plotters and will be the
better for your absence,&rdquo; he had said. &ldquo;It has been
over long since you have visited your titular estates
and they doubtless require your immediate attention.
You are, therefore, permitted to depart to them
forthwith&mdash;and to remain indefinitely.&rdquo; Surely, it
was very general and precluded only a return to
Dornlitz.</p>
<p>That the question of the succession was behind
it all, she was very well persuaded; the family
laws of the Dalbergs were secret, undisclosed to any
but the ranking members of the House, but the
Crown had always descended by male primogeniture.
The advent of Armand, the eldest male descendant
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
of Hugo Dalberg (who had been banished by his
father, the Great Henry, when he had gone to
America and taken service under Washington) had
tangled matters, for Armand was senior in line to
Lotzen. It was known that Henry, shortly before
his death, had revoked the former decree and restored
Hugo and his children to their rank and
estates; and Frederick had proclaimed this decree to
the Nation and had executed it in favor of Armand,
making him an Archduke and Colonel of the Red
Huzzars. But what no one knew was whether
Lotzen had hereby been displaced as Heir Presumptive.
How far did the Great Henry&rsquo;s decree of
restoration extend? How far had Frederick made
it effective? In short, would the next King be Ferdinand,
Duke of Lotzen, or Armand, Archduke of
Valeria?</p>
<p>And to Madeline Spencer the answer was of deep
concern; and she had been man&oelig;uvering to draw it
from the Duke ever since she had come to the Castle.
But every time she had led up to it, he had led away,
and with evident deliberation. Plainly there was
something in the Laws that made it well for him to
drive the King no further; and what could it be but
the power to remove him as Heir Presumptive.</p>
<p>And as Lotzen knew the answer, she would know
it, too. If he were not to be king, she had no notion
to entangle herself further with him; he was
then too small game for her bow; and there would
be a very chill welcome for her in Dornlitz from
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
Queen Dehra. But should he get the Crown&mdash;well,
there are worse positions than a king&rsquo;s favorite&mdash;for
a few months&mdash;the open-handed months.</p>
<p>So she slipped an arm about his shoulders and let
a whisp of perfumed hair flirt across his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why won&rsquo;t you go to
Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed and lightly pinched her cheek. &ldquo;Because
I&rsquo;m surer of you here. Paris breeds too many
rivals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet I left them all to come here,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now you would go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled up at him. &ldquo;Yes, but with you, dear&mdash;not
alone.&rdquo; Her hand stole into his. &ldquo;Tell me,
sweetheart, why you will not go&mdash;might it cause
Frederick to deprive you of the succession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a space the Duke made no answer, gazing the
while steadily into the distance, with eyebrows
slightly drawn. And she, having dared so far, dared
further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, dear, he would not wrong you by making
Armand king!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as though the
thought had but that moment come.</p>
<p>He turned to her with quick sympathy, a look of
warm appreciation in his eyes. The answer she had
played for trembled on his lips&mdash;then died
unspoken.</p>
<p>He bent down and kissed her forehead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We of the Dalbergs still believe, my dear, that
the King can do no wrong,&rdquo; he said, and swung her
to the floor. &ldquo;Come, let us walk on the wall, and
forget everything except that we are together, and
that I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She closed her eyes to hide the flash of angry
disappointment, though her voice was calm and easy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love!&rdquo; she laughed; &ldquo;love! what is it? The
infatuation of the moment&mdash;the pleasure of an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hence this eagerness for Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him a quick glance. &ldquo;May be, my
lord, to prolong our moment; to extend our hour.&rdquo;
He paused, his hand upon the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And otherwise are they ended?&rdquo; he asked
quietly.</p>
<p>She let her eyes seek the door. &ldquo;No&mdash;not yet.&rdquo;
He slowly closed the door and leaned against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Madeline,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let us deal
frankly with each other. I am not so silly as to
think you love me, though I&rsquo;m willing to admit I
wish you did. You have fascinated me&mdash;ever since
that evening in the Hanging Garden when you
made the play of being the Archduke Armand&rsquo;s
wife. Love may be what you style it: &lsquo;the infatuation
of the moment; the pleasure of an hour.&rsquo; If
so, for you, my moment and my hour still linger.
But with you, I know, there is a different motive;
you may like me passing well&mdash;I believe you do&mdash;yet
it was not that which brought you here, away
from Paris&mdash;&lsquo;the boulevards and the music.&rsquo; You
came because&mdash;well, what matters the because: you
came; and for that I am very grateful; they have
been pleasant days for me&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>She had been gazing through the window; now
she looked him in the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for me as well,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; he answered gravely&mdash;&rdquo;and it shall
not be I that ends them. You wish to know if I am
still the Heir Presumptive. You shall have your
answer: I do not know. It rests with the King. He
has the power to displace me in favor of Armand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled comprehendingly. It was as she had
feared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Princess Royal is betrothed to Armand,&rdquo;
she commented.</p>
<p>Lotzen shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Do you wonder I may not go to Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went over to the fireplace, and sitting on the
arm of a chair rested her slender feet on the fender,
her silk clad ankles glistening in the fire-light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why, when
the American was restored to Hugo&rsquo;s rank, he did
not, by that very fact, become also Heir Presumptive&mdash;his
line is senior to yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was room on the chair arm for another and
he took it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have touched the very point,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Henry the Third himself restored Hugo and his
heirs to rank and estate; but it needs Frederick&rsquo;s
decree to make him eligible to the Crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has he made it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;I do not know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, surely, it would be promulgated, if he
had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very probably; but not necessarily. All that is
required is a line in the big book which for centuries
has contained the Laws of the Dalbergs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She studied the tip of her shoe, tapping it the
while on the fender rod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will this marriage be solemnized?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>He laughed rather curtly. &ldquo;Never, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him a quick look. &ldquo;So&mdash;the wound
still hurts. I beg your pardon; I did not mean to
be unkind. I was only thinking that, if the decree
were not yet made, the wedding would be sure to
bring it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put his arm around her waist and drew her
over until the black hair pressed his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Madeline, you are quite wrong,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;The Princess is nothing to me now&mdash;nothing but
the King&rsquo;s daughter and the American&rsquo;s chief advocate.
I meant what you did:&mdash;that the marriage
will lose me the Crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she suffered his embrace, watching
him the while through half closed eyes; then she
drew away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose there is no way to prevent the marriage,&rdquo;
she remarked, her gaze upon the fire.</p>
<p>He arose and, crossing to the table, found a
cigarette.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can you suggest a way?&rdquo; he asked, his back
toward her, the match aflame, poised before his face.</p>
<p>She had turned and was watching him with
sharp interest, but she did not answer, and when he
glanced around, in question, she was looking at the
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want a cigarette?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She nodded, and he took it to her and held the
match for its lighting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked you if you could suggest a way,&rdquo; he
remarked.</p>
<p>She blew a smoke ring toward the ceiling. &ldquo;Yes,
go back to Dornlitz and kill the American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go with me?&rdquo; banteringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; with a reminiscent smile; &ldquo;I
have quite too vivid a memory of my recent visit
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the killing&mdash;shall I do it by proxy or in
person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any way&mdash;so it is done&mdash;though one&rsquo;s best
servant is one&rsquo;s self, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had thought her jesting, but now he leaned
forward to see her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, you do not mean it,&rdquo; he said uncertainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true you have
already tried both ways&mdash;and failed; but that is no
assurance of the future. The second, or some other
try may win.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>A tolerant smile crossed his lips. &ldquo;And meanwhile,
of course, the American would wait patiently
to be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;You seem to have
forgot that steel vests do not protect the head; and
that several swords might penetrate a guard which
one could not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;surely, you must have
loved this man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put his words aside with a wave of her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My advice is quite impersonal,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;and
it is only trite advice at that, as you know. You
have yourself considered it already scores of times,
and have been deterred only by the danger to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you cannot go over to
my enemies. You read my mind too accurately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; she retorted; &ldquo;Armand knows it
quite as well as I, though possibly he may not yet
have realized how timid you have grown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Timid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded. &ldquo;Yes, timid; you had plenty of
nerve at first, when the American came; but it seems
to have run to water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I shall lose, you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tossed the cigarette among the red ashes and
arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you win, Ferdinand?&rdquo; she asked&mdash;then
a sly smile touched her lips&mdash;&ldquo;so far as I have
observed, you haven&rsquo;t troubled even so much as to
pray for success.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>He leaned forward and drew her back to the place
beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience, Madeline, patience,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;some
day I&rsquo;m going back to Dornlitz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see the Archduke Armand crowned?&rdquo; she
scoffed.</p>
<p>He bent his head close to her ear. &ldquo;I trust so&mdash;with
the diadem that never fades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed. &ldquo;Trust and hope are the weapons
of the apathetic. Why don&rsquo;t you, at least, deal in
predictions; sometimes they inspire deeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; he said smilingly. &ldquo;I predict that
there is another little game for you and me to play
in Dornlitz, and that we shall be there before many
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an absent-minded prophet,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;I told you I would not go to Dornlitz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I need you, Madeline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;Transfer the game to
Paris, or any place outside Valeria, and I will gladly
be your partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her hand. &ldquo;Will nothing persuade
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She faced him instantly. &ldquo;Nothing, my lord,
nothing, so long as Frederick is king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke lifted her hand and tapped it softly
against his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tres bien ma ch&egrave;re, tres bien</i>,&rdquo; he said; then
frowned, as Mrs. Spencer&rsquo;s maid entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pour Monsieur le Duc</i>,&rdquo; she curtsied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>Lotzen took the card from the salver and turned
it over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see him at once,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;have him
shown to my private cabinet.... It is
Bigler,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not have him here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well; I thought you trusted me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He struck the bell. &ldquo;Show Count Bigler here,&rdquo;
he ordered. Then when the maid had gone: &ldquo;There,
Madeline, that should satisfy you, for I have no
idea what brings him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went quickly to him, and leaning over his
shoulder lightly kissed his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you trusted me, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but a
woman likes to have it demonstrated, now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to catch her; but she sprang away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Ferdinand, no,&rdquo; as he pursued her; &ldquo;the
Count is coming&mdash;go and sit down.&rdquo;&mdash;She tried to
reach her boudoir, but with a laugh he headed her
off, and slowly drove her into a corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surrender,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be merciful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer there came the swish of high-held
skirts, a vision of black silk stockings and white
lace, and she was across a huge sofa, and, with
flushed face and merry eyes, had turned and faced
him.</p>
<p>And as they stood so, Count Bigler was announced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, my dear Bigler, welcome!&rdquo; the Duke
exclaimed, hurrying over to greet him; &ldquo;you are
surely Heaven sent.... Madame Spencer,
I think you know the Count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw the look of sharp surprise that Bigler
tried to hide by bowing very low, and she laughed
gayly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, you do come in good time, my lord,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;we were so put to for amusement we were
reduced to playing tag around the room&mdash;don&rsquo;t be
shocked; you will be playing it too, if you are here
for long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it carry the usual penalty,&rdquo; he answered,
joining in her laugh, &ldquo;I am very ready to play it
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; said the Duke dryly, motioning him
to a chair. &ldquo;But first, tell us the gossip of the
Capital; we have heard nothing for weeks. What&rsquo;s
my dear cousin Armand up to&mdash;not dying, I
fear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dying! Not he&mdash;not while there are any honors
handy, with a doting King to shower them on him,
and a Princess waiting for wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke&rsquo;s face, cold at best, went yet colder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the wedding date been announced?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not formally, but I understand it has been fixed
for the twenty-seventh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lotzen glanced at a calendar. &ldquo;Three weeks
from to-morrow&mdash;well, much may happen in that
time. Come,&rdquo; he said good-naturedly, shaking off
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
the irritation, &ldquo;tell us all you know&mdash;everything&mdash;from
the newest dance at the opera to the tattle of
the Clubs. I said you were Heaven sent&mdash;now prove
it. But first&mdash;was it wise for you to come here?
What will Frederick say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count laughed. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not here; I&rsquo;m in
Paris, on two weeks leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paris!&rdquo; the Duke exclaimed. &ldquo;Surely, this
Paris fever is the very devil; are you off to-night or
in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bigler shot a quick glance at Mrs. Spencer, and
understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not to Paris at all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;unless you
send me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t do that, Monsieur le Comte,&rdquo; the lady
laughed; and Lotzen, who had quite missed the
hidden meaning in their words, nodded in affirmance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your budget&mdash;out with it.
I&rsquo;m athirst for news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count drew out a cigar and, at Mrs. Spencer&rsquo;s
smile of permission, he lighted it, and began his
tale. And it took time in the telling, for the Duke
was constant in his questions, and a month is very
long for such as he to be torn from his usual life
and haunts.</p>
<p>And, through it all, Mrs. Spencer lay back in
sinuous indolence among the cushions on the couch
before the fire, one hand behind her shapely head,
her eyes, languidly indifferent, upon the two men,
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
her thoughts seemingly far away. And while he
talked, Count Bigler watched her curiously, but
discreetly. This was the first time he had seen the
famous &ldquo;Woman in Black&rdquo; so closely, and her
striking beauty fairly stunned him. He knew his
Paris and Vienna well, but her equal was not there&mdash;no,
nor elsewhere, he would swear. Truly, he had
wasted his sympathy on Lotzen&mdash;he needed none of
it with such a companion for his exile.</p>
<p>And she, unseeing, yet seeing all, read much of
his thoughts; and presently, from behind her heavy
lashes, she flashed a smile upon him&mdash;half challenge,
half rebuke&mdash;then turned her face from him, nor
shifted it until the fading daylight wrapped her in
its shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, my tale is told,&rdquo; the Count ended. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
empty as a broken bottle&mdash;and as dry,&rdquo; and he
poured himself a glass of wine from the decanter on
a side table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a rare gossip, truly,&rdquo; said the Duke;
&ldquo;but you have most carefully avoided the one matter
that interests me most:&mdash;what do they say of me
in Dornlitz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bigler shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Why ask?&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;You know quite well the Capital does not
love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, therefore, no reason for me to be sensitive.
Come, out with it. What do they say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Bigler, &ldquo;if you want it, here
it is:&mdash;they have the notion that you are no longer
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
the Heir Presumptive, and it seems to give them vast
delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke nodded. &ldquo;And on what is the notion
based?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Originally, on hope, I fancy; but lately it has
become accepted that the King not only has the
power to displace you, but has actually signed the
decree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Frederick&mdash;does he encourage the idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count shook his head. &ldquo;No, except by his
open fondness for the American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been urged to go to Dornlitz and kill the
American,&rdquo; Lotzen remarked, with a smile and a
nod toward Mrs. Spencer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can kill him,&rdquo; said Bigler instantly, &ldquo;the
advice is excellent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. And if I can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s the end of me&mdash;and
my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think your friends would gladly try the hazard,&rdquo;
the Count answered. &ldquo;It is dull prospect and
small hope for them, even now. And candidly, my
lord, to my mind, it&rsquo;s your only chance, if you wish
the Crown; for, believe me, the Archduke Armand
is fixed for the succession, and the day he weds the
Princess Royal will see him formally proclaimed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke strode to the far end of the room and
back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your honest advice&mdash;to go to Dornlitz?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>The other arose and raised his hand in salute.
&ldquo;It is, sir; and not mine alone, but Gimels&rsquo; and
Rosen&rsquo;s and Whippen&rsquo;s, and all the others&rsquo;&mdash;that is
what brought me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you any plan arranged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count nodded ever so slightly, then looked
the Duke steadily in the face&mdash;and the latter understood.</p>
<p>He turned to Madeline Spencer. &ldquo;Come nearer,
my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we may need your quick wit&mdash;there
is plotting afoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him a smile of appreciation, and came
and took the chair he offered, and he motioned for
Bigler to proceed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, first, tell me,&rdquo; he interjected, &ldquo;am I to go
to Dornlitz openly or in disguise? I don&rsquo;t fancy the
latter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Openly,&rdquo; said the Count. &ldquo;Having been in
exile a month, you can venture to return and throw
yourself on Frederick&rsquo;s mercy. We think he will
receive you and permit you to remain&mdash;but, at least,
it will give you two days in Dornlitz, and, if our
plan does not miscarry, that will be quite ample.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; the Duke commented; &ldquo;but my
going will depend upon how I like your plot; let us
have it&mdash;and in it, I trust you have not overlooked
my fiasco at the Vierle Masque and so hung it all on
my single sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your sword may be very necessary, but, if so, it
won&rsquo;t be alone. We have several plans&mdash;the one we
hope to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>A light tap on the door interrupted him, and a
servant entered, with the bright pink envelope that,
in Valeria, always contained a telegram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My recall to Court,&rdquo; laughed the Duke, and
drawing out the message glanced at it indifferently.</p>
<p>But it seemed to take him unduly long to read it;
and when, at length, he folded it, his face was very
grave; and he sat silent, staring at the floor, creasing
and recreasing the sheet with nervous fingers, and
quite oblivious to the two who were watching him,
and the servant standing stiffly at attention at his
side.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from without, arose a mad din of
horses&rsquo; hoofs and human voices, as the returning
cavalcade dashed into the courtyard, women and
men yelling like fiends possessed. And it roused the
Duke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may go,&rdquo; to the footman; &ldquo;there is no
answer now.&rdquo; He waited until the door closed; then
held up the telegram. &ldquo;His Majesty died, suddenly,
this afternoon,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Count Bigler sprang half out of his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frederick dead! the King dead!&rdquo; he cried&mdash;&ldquo;then,
in God&rsquo;s name, who now is king&mdash;you or the
American?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke arose. &ldquo;That is what we are about to
find out,&rdquo; he said, very quietly. &ldquo;Come, we will go
to Dornlitz.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<h2 id="c2">II
<br /><span class="small">TO-MORROW AND THE BOOK</span></h2>
<p>Frederick of Valeria had died as every strong
man wants to die: suddenly and in the midst of his
affairs, with the full vigor of life still upon him and
no premonition of the end. It had been a sharp
straightening in saddle, a catch of breath, a lift of
hand toward heart, and then, with the great band
of the Foot Guards thundering before him, and the
regiment swinging by in review, he had sunk slowly
over and into the arms of the Archduke Armand.
And as he held him, there was a quick touch of surgeon&rsquo;s
fingers to pulse and breast, a shake of head,
a word; and then, sorrowfully and in silence, they
bore him away; while the regiment, wheeling sharply
into line, spread across the parade and held back
the populace. And presently, as the people lingered,
wondering and fearful, and the Guards stood stolid
in their ranks, the royal standard on the great tower
of the Castle dropped slowly to half staff, and the
mellow bell of the Cathedral began to toll, to all
Valeria, the mournful message that her King was
dead.</p>
<p>And far out in the country the Princess Dehra
heard it, but faintly; and drawing rein, she listened
in growing trepidation for a louder note. Was it
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the Cathedral bell?&mdash;the bell that tolled only when a
Dalberg died! For a while she caught no stroke,
and the fear was passing, when down the wind it
came, clear and strong&mdash;and again&mdash;and yet again.</p>
<p>And with blanched cheek and fluttering heart she
was racing at top speed toward Dornlitz, staying
neither for man nor beast, nor hill nor stream, the
solemn clang smiting her ever harder and harder in
the face. There were but two for whom it could be
speaking, her father and her lover&mdash;for she gave no
thought to Lotzen or his brother, Charles. And
now, which?&mdash;which?&mdash;which? Mile after mile
went behind her in dust and flying stones, until
six were passed, and then the outer guard post rose
in front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bell!&rdquo; she cried, as the sentry sprang to
attention, &ldquo;the bell, man, the bell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soldier grounded arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the King,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But as the word was spoken she was gone&mdash;joy
and sorrow now fighting strangely in her heart&mdash;and
as she dashed up the wide Avenue, the men uncovered
and the women breathed a prayer; but she,
herself, saw only the big, gray building with the
drooping flag, and toward it she sped, the echo of
the now silent bell still ringing in her ears.</p>
<p>The Castle gates were closed, and before them
with drawn swords, stern and impassive, sat two
huge Cuirassiers of the Guard; they heard the
nearing hoof beats, and, over the heads of the crowd
that hung about the entrance, they saw and understood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stand back!&rdquo; they cried; &ldquo;stand back&mdash;the
Princess comes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the gates swung open, and the big sorrel
horse, reeking with sweat and flecked with foam and
dust, flashed by, and on across the courtyard. And
Colonel Moore, who was about to ride away, sprang
down and swung her out of saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me to him,&rdquo; she said quietly, as he stood
aside to let her pass.</p>
<p>She swayed slightly at the first step, and her legs
seemed strangely stiff and heavy, but she slipped
her hand through his arm and drove herself along.
And so he led her, calm and dry-eyed, down the long
corridor and through the ante-room to the King&rsquo;s
chamber, and all who met them bowed head and
drew back. At the threshold she halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you please bid all retire,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
would see my father alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when he had done her will, he came and held
open the door for her a little way, then stood at
attention and raised his hand in salute; and the
Princess went in to her dead.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Archduke Armand was searching
for the Princess. The moment he had seen the King
at rest in the Castle, declining all escort, he had
galloped away for the Summer Palace, first ordering
that no information should be conveyed there by telephone.
It was a message for him to deliver in
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
person, though he shrank from it, as only a man
can shrink from such a duty. But he knew nothing
of the Cathedral bell and its tolling, and when, as he
neared the Park, the first note broke upon him, he
listened in surprise; then he grasped its meaning,
and with an imprecation, spurred the faster, racing
now with a brazen clapper as to which should tell the
Princess first. And the sentry at the gate stared
in wonder; but the officer on duty at the main
entrance ran out to meet him, knowing instantly for
whom the bell was tolling and for whom the Archduke
came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her Highness is not here,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;She rode
away alone by the North Avenue a short while ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make report to the Castle the instant she returns,&rdquo;
Armand called, and was gone&mdash;to follow her,
as he thought, on the old forge road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye Gods!&rdquo; the officer exclaimed, &ldquo;that was the
King&mdash;the new King!&rdquo; and mechanically he clicked
his heels together and saluted.</p>
<p>Nor did he imagine that all unwittingly he had
sent his master far astray; for the Princess had gone
but a little way by the North Avenue, and then had
circled over to the South gate.</p>
<p>And so Armand searched vainly, until at last,
bearing around toward Dornlitz, he struck the main
highway and learned that she had passed long since,
making for the Capital as fast as horse could run.
And he knew that the Bell had been the messenger,
and that there was now naught for him to do but to
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
return with all speed and give such comfort as he
might. Though what to do or to say he had no
idea&mdash;for never before had he been called upon to
minister to a woman&rsquo;s grief; and he pondered upon
it with a misgiving that was at its deepest when,
at length, he stood outside her door and heard her
bid the servant to admit him.</p>
<p>But if he looked for tears and trembling he was
disappointed, for she met him as she had met those
in the corridor and the ante-room, dry-eyed and
calmly. And in silence he took her in his arms, and
held her close, and stroked her shining hair.</p>
<p>And presently she put his arms aside, and stepping
back, she curtsied low and very gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life to Your Majesty!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;long live
the King!&rdquo; and kissed his hand.</p>
<p>He raised her quickly. &ldquo;Never bend knee to me,
Dehra,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And believe me, I had quite
forgot everything except that you had lost your
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went back to him. &ldquo;And so had I, dear, until
you came; but now, since he is gone, you are all I
have&mdash;is it very selfish, then, for me to think of you
so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew her to a chair and stood looking down
at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am surely not the one to
judge you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>She shook her head sadly. &ldquo;There is no one to
judge but&mdash;him,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;and he, I know,
would give me full approval.&rdquo; She was silent for a
while, her thoughts in the darkened room across the
court, where the tapers burned dimly, and a Captain
of the Guard kept watch. And her heart sobbed
afresh, though her lips were mute and her eyes undimmed.
At last she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the Book of Laws at the Summer Palace or
here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Armand, &ldquo;I have never
seen it except the day that the King read old
Henry&rsquo;s decree and offered me Hugo&rsquo;s titles and
estates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at least, he spoke of it to you to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand shook his head. &ldquo;Never a word; neither
to-day nor for many days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A faint frown showed between her eyes. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
he mention to you, this afternoon, the matter of
the Succession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat up sharply. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be he didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke dropped on the floor at her feet
and took her hand. &ldquo;I assure you, Dehra, the King
didn&rsquo;t speak a single word to me on such a matter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/img1.jpg" alt="&ldquo;THE KING DIDN&rsquo;T SPEAK A SINGLE WORD TO ME ON SUCH A MATTER.&rdquo;" width="489" height="708" />
<p class="center"><small>&ldquo;THE KING DIDN&rsquo;T SPEAK A SINGLE WORD TO ME ON SUCH A MATTER.&rdquo;</small></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t understand. I
mean it can not be he didn&rsquo;t make the decree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The decree!&rdquo; Armand exclaimed, though he
knew well there was but one she would refer to; and
his pulse bounded fiercely and his face grew very
hot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear&mdash;the decree&mdash;that would have made
you Heir Presumptive&mdash;and now King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think it was drawn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King told you so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not directly, but by inference. I came upon
him late last night in his library, with the Laws open
before him and a pen in his hand; and when I ventured
to voice my curiosity, he smiled and closed the
book, saying, &lsquo;You may see it to-morrow, child;
after I have told Armand.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless he intended to tell me after the
review.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess leaned over and put her arm around
his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you are the King, dear; as he had
always intended you should be,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;Thank God, the decree was made in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while Armand toyed with her slender fingers,
and did not answer. Of course, she was right:&mdash;it
was the decree they both had been hoping for
so earnestly, but which neither had dared mention
to the King. And now, when it had come, and in
such fashion, was it really worth the while. Worth
the turmoil and the trouble, and, may be, the fighting,
that was sure to follow his assumption of the
royal dignity. Had Frederick lived to proclaim
the decree and to school the Nation into accepting
him as his successor, the way would have been easy
and well assured. But it was vastly different now&mdash;with
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Frederick dead, the decree yet to be announced,
and few, doubtless, of those in authority
around him, to be depended on to aid him hold the
throne. Dalberg though he was, and now, by birth,
the Head of the House, yet he was a foreigner, and
no people take kindly to a foreign King. Frederick
had died too soon&mdash;another year&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>And Dehra, bending down questioning his abstraction,
read his face and understood his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the crisis is here, and we
must face it. Dismiss the idea that you&rsquo;re a foreigner.
Only you and Lotzen and I are familiar
with our Laws. You forget that the people do not
know it required a special decree to make you eligible
for the Crown; and to them you have been the next
King ever since you were proclaimed as Hugo&rsquo;s heir.
And surely they have shown you a rare good will,
and an amazing preference over the Duke. He
has spent his whole life in cultivating their dislike;
do you fancy it won&rsquo;t bring its harvest now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had turned and was watching her with an
indulgent smile. It was sweet to hear her argue so;
to see her intense devotion to his cause; her passionate
desire that he should sit in her father&rsquo;s place and
rule the ancient monarchy. And at her first words,
and the sight of her loving eyes and flushed cheeks,
his doubts had vanished, and his decision had been
made. Yet, because he liked to see her so, he led
her on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what of the Nobility,&rdquo; he objected; &ldquo;in
Valeria they still lead the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; she answered instantly, &ldquo;true; but you
forget again that the Nobles are sworn to maintain
the Laws of the Dalbergs; and that for centuries
none has ever broken faith. No, no, Armand, they
will be true to their oaths; they will uphold the
decree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, dear,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;you are
making it rather too assured? If the people are for
me (or at least are not for Lotzen) and the Nobles
will abide by the Laws, nothing remains but to
mount the Throne and seize the sceptre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about that, I fancy,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, meanwhile, what will Lotzen be doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She frowned. &ldquo;Whatever the Head of his House
orders him to do. As a Dalberg he is bound to
obey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think he will obey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I surely do. I cannot imagine a Dalberg dishonoring
the Book of Laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear you do not know Ferdinand of Lotzen,&rdquo;
said Armand seriously. &ldquo;He intends to dispute the
Succession. I have never told you how, long ago,
he warned me what to expect if I undertook to &lsquo;filch
the Crown,&rsquo; as he put it. It was the afternoon he
insulted me at headquarters&mdash;the Vierle Masque was
in the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>The Princess nodded eagerly. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;yes&mdash;I know&mdash;the time he wanted you to toss up
a coin for me. What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke reflected a moment. &ldquo;I can give
you his exact words: &lsquo;Do you think,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that
I, who have been the Heir Presumptive since the
instant of my birth, almost, will calmly step aside
and permit you to take my place? Do you fancy
for an instant that the people of Valeria would have
a foreigner for King? And even if old Frederick
were to become so infatuated with you that he would
restore you to Hugo&rsquo;s place in the line of Succession,
do you imagine that the House of Nobles would
hesitate to annul it the instant he died?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had finished, Dehra&rsquo;s fingers were beating
a tattoo on the chair&rsquo;s arm, and her eyes were
snapping&mdash;as once or twice he had seen Frederick&rsquo;s
snap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose you never told the King?&rdquo; she
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; with a toss of the handsome
head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s way&mdash;his silly, senseless
way&mdash;never tell tales about a rival. And as a
result, see what a mess you have made. Had you
informed the King, he instantly would have proclaimed
you as his heir, and then disgraced Lotzen
publicly and sent him into exile. And you would
now be his successor, without a shadow of opposition.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Armand subdued a smile. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,
Dehra&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; she cut in; &ldquo;quite right; I don&rsquo;t.
Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me? I would have told the
King, you may be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you would, little woman; that&rsquo;s just
the reason I didn&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders, and the tattoo began
afresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no patience with such nonsense,&rdquo; she declared;
&ldquo;Lotzen deserved no gentlemanly consideration;
he would have shown none to you; and besides,
it was your duty to your King and your House
to uphold the Laws of the Dalbergs and to prevent
any attempt to violate them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very much afraid that lately, between
Lotzen and myself, the Laws of the Dalbergs have
been sadly slighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His bantering jarred upon her. &ldquo;To me, Armand,&rdquo;
she answered gravely, &ldquo;our Laws are holy.
For almost a thousand years they have been our
unchallenged rule of governance. I can understand
why, to you, they have no sacredness and no sentiment;
but Lotzen has been born and bred under
them, and should honor them with his life&mdash;and more
especially as they alone made him the Heir Presumptive.
But for the decree of the first Dalberg
King, four hundred years ago, I would be the Queen-Regent
of Valeria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity, a crying pity!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>She looked down at him with shining eyes. &ldquo;No,
dear, it isn&rsquo;t; once I thought it was; but now I&rsquo;m
quite content to be Queen-consort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took both her hands and held them between
his own. &ldquo;That, dear, is what makes it possible,
and worth the struggle; and if Valeria does accept
me as its King, it will be solely for love of you, and
to get you for its Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile of satisfaction crossed her face. &ldquo;I
hope the people do love me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I would
like to feel I may have helped you, even a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little! but for you, my princess, I&rsquo;d go back
to America and leave the way clear for Lotzen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed softly. &ldquo;No, no, Armand, you
would do nothing of the sort. A Dalberg never ran
from duty&mdash;and least of all the Dalberg whom God
has made in the image of the greatest of them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced in the tall mirror across the room. He
was wearing the dress uniform of the Red Huzzars
(who had been inspected immediately before the
Foot Guards; and he, as titular Colonel, had led
them in the march by), and there was no denying
he made a handsome figure, in the brilliant tunic
and black, fur-bound dohlman, his Orders sparkling,
his sword across his knees.</p>
<p>She put her head close beside his and smiled at
him in the mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry the Great was not at all bad looking,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>He smiled back at her. &ldquo;But with a beastly bad
temper, at times, I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid&mdash;I mean his wife wasn&rsquo;t afraid;
tradition is, she managed him very skilfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; he agreed; &ldquo;any clever woman can
manage a man if she take the trouble to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall I try, Armand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try!&rdquo; he chuckled; &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t help trying;
man taming is your natural avocation. By all
means, manage me&mdash;only, don&rsquo;t let me know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not,&rdquo; she laughed&mdash;&ldquo;the King never&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
and she straightened sharply. &ldquo;I forgot, dear, I
forgot!&rdquo; And she got up suddenly, and went over
to the window. Nor did he follow her; but waited
silently, knowing well it was no time for him even
to intrude.</p>
<p>After a while she came slowly back to him, a
wistfully sad look in her eyes. And as he met her
she gave him both her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never be anything but a thoughtless
child, Armand,&rdquo; she said, with a wan, little smile.
&ldquo;So be kind to me, dear&mdash;and don&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew her arms about his neck. &ldquo;Let us
always be children to each other,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;forgetting, when together, everything but the joy
of living, the pleasures of to-day, the anticipations
of to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;A woman is always a child
in love,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the man who grows into
maturity, and sobers with age.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>He knew quite well she was right, and for the
moment he had no words to answer; and she understood
and helped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is no time for either of us to be children,&rdquo;
she went on; &ldquo;there is work to do and plans
to be arranged.&rdquo; She drew a chair close to the table
and, resting both arms upon it, looked up at the
Archduke expectantly. &ldquo;What is first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, dear,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;Frederick was my
father and my dearest friend, but there remains for
him now only the last sad offices the living do the
dead; we will do them; but we will also do what he
has decreed. We will seat you in his place, and
confound Lotzen and his satellites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her hand and gravely raised it to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a rare woman, Dehra,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a rare
woman. No man can reach your level, nor understand
the beauty of your faith, the meaning of your
love. Yet, at least, will I try to do you honor and
to give you truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew him down and kissed him lightly on the
cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know the Dalberg women, dear,&rdquo;
she said&mdash;&ldquo;to them the King is next to God&mdash;and
the line that separates is very narrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not yet the King,&rdquo; he protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been king, in fact, since the moment&mdash;Frederick
died. With us, the tenet still obtains in
all its ancient strength; the throne is never vacant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s Lotzen or I, and to-morrow the Book
will decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed; &ldquo;to-morrow the Book will
decide for the Nation; but <i>we</i> know it will be you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; he smiled; &ldquo;we think we know;
we can&rsquo;t be sure until we see the decree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt,&rdquo; she averred, &ldquo;my father&rsquo;s
words can bear but one construction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem so&mdash;yet I&rsquo;ve long learned that,
in this life, it&rsquo;s the certain things that usually are
lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprang up. &ldquo;Why not settle it at once&mdash;let
us send for the Book; of course it is at the Palace&mdash;it
was there last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head decisively. &ldquo;No, dear, no;
believe me it is not wise now for either of us to touch
the Book. It were best that it be opened only by the
Prime Minister in presence of the Royal Council.
We must give Lotzen no reason to cry forgery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Small good would
it do him, as against Frederick&rsquo;s writing and my
testimony. However, we can wait&mdash;the Council
meets in the morning, I assume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; at ten o&rsquo;clock, at the Palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up quickly. &ldquo;The key?&rdquo; she asked;
&ldquo;it was always on his watch chain&mdash;have you got
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I never thought of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rang the bell and sent for the Chamberlain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me King Frederick&rsquo;s watch, and the
Orders he was wearing,&rdquo; she said. When they came
she handed the Orders to Armand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are yours now, dear,&rdquo; she said. She took
the watch and held up the chain, from the end of
which hung the small, antique key of the brass bound
box, in which the Book of Laws had been kept for
centuries that now reached back to tradition. She
contemplated, for a moment, the swaying bit of gold
and bronze, then loosed it from the ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This also is yours, Sire,&rdquo; she said, and proffered
it to him.</p>
<p>But he declined. &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the meantime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Count Epping is still in the Castle, we will
let him hold it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess nodded in approval. &ldquo;Doubtless
that is wiser,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;though quite unprecedented;
none but the King ever holds that key, save
when he rides to war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are dealing with a situation that has no
precedents,&rdquo; he smiled; &ldquo;we must make some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he went toward the bell, a servant entered with
a card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admit him,&rdquo; he said.... &ldquo;It is Epping,&rdquo;
he explained.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister of Valeria was one of those
extraordinary exceptions that occasionally occur in
public officials; he had no purpose in life but to
serve his King. Without regard to his own private
ends or personal ambition, he had administered his
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
office for a generation, and Frederick trusted him
as few monarchs ever trusted a powerful subject.
To the Nation, he was honesty and justice incarnate,
and only the King and the Princess Royal excelled
him in popularity and respect. Seventy years had
passed over the tall and slender figure, leaving a
crown of silver above the pale, lean face, with its
tight-shut mouth, high cheek bones and faded blue
eyes; but they had brought no stoop to the shoulders,
nor feebleness to the step, nor dullness to the
brain.</p>
<p>He saluted Armand with formal dignity; then
bent over Dehra&rsquo;s hand, silently and long&mdash;and
when he rose a tear was trembling on his lashes. He
dashed it away impatiently and turned to the Archduke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and Armand, in sheer surprise,
made no objection&mdash;&ldquo;I have brought the proclamation
announcing His late Majesty&rsquo;s death and your
accession. It should be published in the morning.
Will it please you to sign it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are moments in life so sharp with emotion
that they cut into one&rsquo;s memory like a sculptor&rsquo;s
tool, and, ever after, stand clear-lined and cameoed
against the blurred background of commonplace
existence. Such was the moment at the Palace
when Frederick had handed him the patents of an
Archduke, and such now was this. &ldquo;Sire!&rdquo; the
word was pounding in his brain. &ldquo;Sire!&rdquo; he, who,
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
less than a year ago, was but a Major in the American
Army; &ldquo;Sire!&rdquo; he&mdash;he&mdash;King of Valeria!</p>
<p>Then, through the mirage, he saw Dehra&rsquo;s smiling
face, and he awoke suddenly to consciousness and
the need for speech, and for immediate decision.
Should he sign the proclamation on the chance that
the decree was in his favor, and that he was, in
truth, the King? He hesitated just an instant&mdash;tempted
by his own desires and by the eager eyes of
the fair woman before him; then he straightened his
shoulders and chose the way of prudence.</p>
<p>He waved the Prime Minister to a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pardon, my lord,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;your form
of address was so new and unexpected, it for the
moment bound my tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man bowed. &ldquo;I think I understand,
Sire,&rdquo; he said, with a smile that, for an instant,
softened amazingly his stern face. &ldquo;Yet, believe
me, one says it to you very naturally&rdquo;&mdash;and his
glance strayed deliberately to the wall opposite,
where hung a small copy of the Great Henry&rsquo;s portrait
in the uniform of the Red Huzzars. &ldquo;It is
very wonderful,&rdquo; he commented;&mdash;&ldquo;and I fancy it
won you instant favor and, even now, may be, makes
us willing to accept you as our King. Sometimes,
Your Majesty, sentiment dominates even a nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I trust sentiment will be content with the
physical resemblance and not examine the idol too
closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count smiled again; this time rather coldly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The first duty of a king is to look like one,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;and sentiment demands nothing else;&rdquo; and,
with placid insistence, he laid the proclamation on
the table beside Armand.</p>
<p>The latter picked it up and read it&mdash;and put it
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I prefer not to exercise any
prerogative of kingship until the Royal Council has
examined the Book of Laws and confirmed my title
under the decrees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The faded blue eyes looked at him contemplatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assumed there was no question as to the
Succession,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor did I mean to intimate there was,&rdquo; Armand
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, with all respect, Sire, I see no reason why
you should not sign the proclamation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand shook his head. &ldquo;May be I am foolish,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;but I will not assume the government
until after the Council to-morrow&mdash;it will do no
harm to delay the proclamation for a few hours.
And, in the interim, you will oblige Her Royal
Highness and me by keeping this key, which she
removed from King Frederick&rsquo;s watch chain, but a
moment before you came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count nodded and took the key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recognize it,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I know the lock
it opens.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Armand; &ldquo;the box is at the Palace,
and doubtless you also know what it contains. For
reasons you may easily appreciate, I desire to avoid
any imputation that the Book has been touched
since His Majesty&rsquo;s demise. You will produce this
key at the meeting to-morrow, explaining how and
where you got it; and then, in the presence of the
Council, I shall open the box and if, by the Laws of
the Dalbergs, I am Head of the House, I will enter
into my heritage and try to keep it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister got up; gladness in his heart,
though his face was quite impassive. He had come
in doubt and misgiving; he was easy now&mdash;here
was a man who led, a man to be served; he asked no
more&mdash;he was content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the proclamation can
wait;&rdquo; then he drew himself to his full height.
&ldquo;God save Your Majesty!&rdquo; he ended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<h2 id="c3">III
<br /><span class="small">THE ROYAL COUNCIL</span></h2>
<p>Count Epping was the last of the five Ministers
to arrive at the Council, the following morning. He
came in, a few minutes before the hour, acknowledged
with grave courtesy, but brief words, the
greetings of the others, and when his secretary had
put his dispatch box on the table he immediately
opened it and busied himself with his papers. It
was his way&mdash;and none of them had ever seen him
otherwise; but now there seemed to be a special significance
in his silence and preoccupation.</p>
<p class="tb">The failure of the Court Journal to appear that
morning had broken a custom that ante-dated the
memory of man, and the information which was
promptly conveyed to the Ministers that it was delayed
until evening, and by the personal order of
the Prime Minister, had provoked both amazement
and expectancy. It could mean only that the paper
was being held for something that must be in that
day&rsquo;s issue, and as they had promptly disclaimed to
one another all responsibility, the inference was not
difficult that it had to do with the new King&rsquo;s first
proclamation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Count was at the Castle last evening,&rdquo;
Duval, the War Minister, had remarked, &ldquo;and I
assumed it was to submit the proclamation and have
it signed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baron Retz, the Minister of Justice, shrugged his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be you assumed correctly,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>The others looked at him with quick interest, but
got only a smile and another shrug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t he sign it?&rdquo; Duval demanded.</p>
<p>The Baron leaned back in his chair and studied
the ceiling. &ldquo;When you say &lsquo;he,&rsquo; you mean&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King, of course,&rdquo; the other snapped.
&ldquo;Who the devil else would I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by &lsquo;the King,&rsquo;&rdquo; drawled Retz, &ldquo;you
mean&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sudden silence&mdash;then General Duval
brought his fist down on the table with a bang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you understand
perfectly whom <i>I</i> meant by the King&mdash;the
Archduke Armand. If he is not the King, and you
know it, it is your duty as a member of the Council
to disclose the fact to us forthwith; this is no time
nor place to indulge in innuendoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baron&rsquo;s small grey eyes turned slowly and,
for a brief instant, lingered, with a dull glitter, on
the War Minister&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear General,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;you are so precipitate.
If you ever lead an army you will deal
only in frontal attacks&mdash;and defeats. I assure you
I <i>know</i> nothing; but to restate your own question: if
the Archduke Armand be the King, why didn&rsquo;t he
sign the proclamation?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Steuben, the grey-bearded Minister of the Interior,
cut in with a growl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the profit of all these wonderful theories?&rdquo;
he demanded, eyeing Retz. &ldquo;The ordinary
and reasonable explanation is that the proclamation
is to be submitted to us this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In which event,&rdquo; said the Baron, &ldquo;we shall have
the explanation in a very few minutes,&rdquo; and resumed
his study of the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the meantime,&rdquo; remarked Admiral Marquand,
&ldquo;I am moved to inquire, where is the Duke
of Lotzen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steuben gave a gruff laugh. &ldquo;Doubtless the Department
of Justice can also offer a violent presumption
on that subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, my friend,&rdquo; said Retz, &ldquo;it will
offer the very natural presumption that the Duke of
Lotzen is hastening to Dornlitz; to the funeral&mdash;and
the coronation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose coronation?&rdquo; Duval asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear General,&rdquo; said the Baron, &ldquo;there can&rsquo;t
be two Kings of Valeria, and it would seem that the
Army has spoken for the Archduke Armand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Department of Justice for whom?&rdquo; the
General exclaimed.</p>
<p>A faint sneer played over Retz&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Monsieur
le General forgets that when the Army speaks,
Justice is bound and gagged.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>It was at that moment that Count Epping had
entered.</p>
<p class="tb">When the clock on the mantel chimed the hour
the Count sat down and motioned the others to
attend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will not the King be present?&rdquo; Retz asked
casually, as he took his place.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister looked at him in studious
comprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience, monsieur, patience,&rdquo; he said softly,
&ldquo;His Majesty will doubtless join us in proper time.
Have you any business that requires his personal
attention?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baron shook his head. &ldquo;No&mdash;nothing. I
was only curious as to what uniform he would wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A faint smile touched the Count&rsquo;s thin lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But more particularly curious as to <i>who</i> would
wear it,&rdquo; he remarked dryly.</p>
<p>Retz swung around and faced him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I would ask you, who is
King in Valeria: the Archduke Armand or Ferdinand
of Lotzen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Minister&rsquo;s smile chilled to a sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a most astonishing question from the
chief law officer of the kingdom,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not so astonishing as that he should be
compelled to ask it,&rdquo; was the quick answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there, then, monsieur, any doubt in your mind
as to the eldest male of the House of Dalberg?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever; but can you assure us that he
is king?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has my assurance to do with the matter?&rdquo;
the Count asked. &ldquo;By the laws of the Dalbergs the
Crown has always passed to the eldest male.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baron laughed quietly. &ldquo;At last we near
the point&mdash;the Laws. There is no doubt that, by
birth, the Archduke Armand is the eldest male; yet
what of the decree of the Great Henry as to Hugo?
As I remember, Frederick explained enough of it to
the Council to cover Armand&rsquo;s assumption of his
ancestor&rsquo;s rank and estates, but said no word as to
the Crown.&rdquo; He leaned forward and looked the old
Count in the eyes. &ldquo;And I ask you now, my lord,
if, under the decree, Armand became the Heir Presumptive,
why was it that, at all our sessions, the
Duke of Lotzen, until his banishment, retained his
place on the King&rsquo;s right, and Armand sat on the
left? Is it not a fair inference, from the actions of
the three men who know the exact words of the
decree, that, though it restored Hugo&rsquo;s heir to
archducal rank, it specifically barred him from the
Crown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister had listened with an impassive
face and now he nodded curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There might be some weight to your argument,
Monsieur le Baron,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you displayed a
more judicial spirit in its presentation&mdash;and if you
did not know otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not permit even you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Retz broke in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>The Count silenced him with a wave of his hand.
&ldquo;You have sat at this board with us, and since the
Duke of Lotzen&rsquo;s absence, at least, you have seen
our dead master treat the Archduke Armand, in
every way, as his successor; and on one occasion, in
your hearing and to your knowledge&mdash;for I saw you
slyly note the exact words, on your cuff&mdash;he referred
to him as the one who would &lsquo;come after.&rsquo;
Hence, I say, you are not honest with the Council.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felicitate your lordship on your powers of
observation and recollection,&rdquo; said Retz suavely;
&ldquo;they are vastly more effective and timely than
mine, which, I confess, hesitate at miracles. But
with due modesty, I submit there is a very simple
way to settle this question quickly and finally. Let
us have the exact words of Henry&rsquo;s decree. I am
well aware it is unprecedented for any but a Dalberg
to see the Dalberg Laws; but we are facing an unprecedented
condition. Never before has a Dalberg
king failed to have a son to follow him. Now, we
hearken back for generations, with a mysterious
juggle intervening; and it is for him who claims the
Throne to prove his title. Before the coming of the
American there was no question that Lotzen was the
Heir Presumptive. Did he lose the place when
Armand became an Archduke? The decree alone
can determine; let it be submitted to the Royal
Council for inspection.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Minister of Justice is overdoing his part,&rdquo;
said the old Count, addressing the other Ministers.
&ldquo;It is not for him nor his Department to dictate the
method by which the Dalbergs shall decide their
kingship, nor does it lie in the mouth of any of us to
demand an inspection of the Book of Laws. So
much for principle and ancient custom. It may be
the pleasure of the Archduke to confirm his right by
exhibiting to us the Laws; or the Duke of Lotzen
may challenge his title, and so force their submission
to us or to the House of Nobles for decision. But,
as the matter stands now, the Council has no discretion.
We must accept the eldest male Dalberg as
King of Valeria; and, as you very well know&rdquo; (looking
directly at Retz) &ldquo;none but a Dalberg may dispute
his claim&mdash;do you, Monsieur le Baron, wish to
be understood as speaking for the Duke of Lotzen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Retz leaned back in his chair and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, my lord, no, no!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I speak
no more for Lotzen than you do for Armand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it would seem&mdash;though not with the same
motives,&rdquo; the Count sneered&mdash;then arose hastily.
&ldquo;The King, my lords, the King!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as
the door in the far corner opened and Armand
entered, unattended, and behind him came a manservant
bearing a brass-bound, black-oak box, inlaid
with silver.</p>
<p>Never had any of the Council seen it, yet instantly
all surmised what it contained; and, courtiers though
they were, they (save the old Count) stared at it so
curiously that the Archduke, with an amused glance
at the latter, turned and motioned the servant to
precede him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Place it before His Excellency, the Prime Minister,&rdquo;
he said; and now the stares shifted, in unfeigned
astonishment to Armand&mdash;while the Count&rsquo;s
thin lips twitched ever so slightly, and, for an instant,
his faded blue eyes actually sparkled, as they
lingered in calm derision on the Baron&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>And Retz, turning suddenly, caught the look and
straightway realized he had been outplayed. He
understood, now, that the Count had been aware, all
along, of the Archduke&rsquo;s purpose to produce the
Laws to the Council, this morning, and that he, by
his very persistence, had given the grim old diplomat
an opportunity to demonstrate, in the most
effective fashion, the unprecedented honor Armand
was now doing them. It was irritating enough to be
out-man&oelig;uvered, but to have his own ammunition
seized and used to enhance another&rsquo;s triumph was
searing to his pride; and, in truth, this was not the
first time that the Prime Minister had left his scar
and a score to settle between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be seated, my lords,&rdquo; said Armand, &ldquo;and
accept my apologies for my tardiness,&rdquo; and he took
the chair at the head of the table.</p>
<p>Count Epping drew his sword and raised it high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valeria hails the Head of the House of Dalberg
as the King!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>And back from the others, as their blades rang
together above the table, came the echo:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We hail the Dalberg King!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the ancient formula, which had always been
used to welcome the new ruler upon his first entrance
to the Royal Council.</p>
<p>And it had come as yet another scar to Retz, for
it put him to the choice&mdash;whether to play the fool
now, or the dastard later&mdash;and that with every eye
upon him, even the Archduke&rsquo;s, whose glance had
instinctively followed the others&rsquo;. Yet he had made
it instantly, smiling mockingly at the Count; and
his voice rang loud and his sword was the last to fall.</p>
<p>But Armand knew nothing of this old ceremony,
and the surprise of it brought him sharply to his
feet, with his hand at the salute, while his face and
brow went ruddy and his fingers chill. It was for
him to speak, he knew, yet speak he could not. But
when led by Count Epping, they crowded close about
him and bent knee and would have kissed his hand, he
drew back and waved them up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, my lords, I thank you from my
heart,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;though not yet will I
assume to accept either the homage or the greeting.
They belong to him who is King of Valeria, and
whether I be he I do not know. As the eldest male,
the presumption is with me; yet as the monarch has
full power to choose his successor from any of the
Dalbergs, it may have been his pleasure, under the
peculiar conditions now existing, to name another as
his heir. Hence it is my purpose to submit to you
the Book of Laws, that you may inspect the decrees
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
and ascertain to whom the Crown descends. I am
informed this is a proceeding utterly unknown; that
the Dalberg Laws are seen only by Dalberg eyes.
Yet, as I apprehend there will be another claimant,
who will have a hearty following, and as, in the end,
it is the Laws that will decide between us, it is best
they should decide now. If, by them, I am King of
Valeria I will assume the Crown and its prerogatives;
and if I am not King, then I will do homage to him
who is, and join with you in his service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, and instantly General Duval flashed
up his sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God save Your Royal Highness!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;God grant that you be King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as the others gave it back for answer, their
blades locked above the Archduke&rsquo;s head, the corridor
door behind them swung open, and Ferdinand
of Lotzen entered and, unnoticed, came slowly down
the room.</p>
<p>All night, with a clear track and a special train,
he had been speeding to the Capital, anxious and
fearful, for in an inter-regnum hours count as days
against the absent claimant to a throne. But when,
at the station, he learned from Baron Rosen that
the Proclamation had not yet been issued and the
Council had been called for ten o&rsquo;clock, the prospect
brightened, and he hurried to the Palace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Yet there was small encouragement in the scene
before him, though the words of the acclaim and the
black box on the table puzzled him. Why, with the
Laws at their disposal, should there be any doubt
as to who was King! So he leaned upon a chair and
waited, a contemptuous smile on his lips, a storm of
hate and anger in his heart. Those shouts, those
swords, those ardent faces should all have been his;
would all have been his, but for this foreigner, this
American, this usurper, this thief. And his fingers
closed about his sword&rsquo;s hilt and, for the shadow of
an instant, he was tempted to spring in and drive
the blade through his rival&rsquo;s throat. But instead he
laughed&mdash;and when at the sound they whirled
around, he laughed again, searching the while every
face with his crafty eyes, and, save in Retz&rsquo;s, finding
no trace of confusion nor regret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty picture, messieurs,&rdquo; he jeered, &ldquo;truly,
a pretty picture&mdash;pray don&rsquo;t let me disturb it;
though I might inquire, since when has the Royal
Council of Valeria gone in for private theatricals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Armand promptly gave him back his laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our cousin of Lotzen appears in good time,&rdquo; he
said very softly. &ldquo;Will he not come into the
picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ferdinand shook his head. &ldquo;In pictures of that
sort, there can be but one central figure,&rdquo; he
answered.</p>
<p>The Archduke swung his hand toward the
Ministers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, quite true,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but there is ample
space for Your Royal Highness in the background.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>Lotzen&rsquo;s face went white, and he measured Armand
with the steady stare of implacable hate,
though on his lips the sneering smile still lingered.</p>
<p>And presently he answered: &ldquo;I trust, monsieur,
you will not mistake my meaning, when I assure you
that there isn&rsquo;t space enough in such a picture to
contain us both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a positive pleasure, Monsieur le Duc,&rdquo; returned
Armand quickly, &ldquo;to find, at last, one matter
in which our minds can meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, for a time, they stood at gaze, while the
others watched them, wondering and in silence.
Then the Archduke spoke again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, my dear cousin, since we understand
each other, I suggest we permit the Royal Council
to continue its session. Be seated, messieurs;&rdquo; and
with a nod to the Ministers, he resumed his place
at the head of the table.</p>
<p>Instantly Lotzen stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lords,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;as Heir Presumptive I
claim the Throne of Valeria. I call upon you, in the
name of the House of Dalberg, to acknowledge me
and to proclaim my accession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon what does Your Royal Highness rest your
claim?&rdquo; Count Epping asked formally.</p>
<p>The Duke pointed to the box; he saw now it was
shut tight and the key not in the lock&mdash;and this,
with what had occurred as he entered, undoubtedly
indicated either that the Book had not yet been
examined or that it contained no decree fixing the
Succession. In either event, he stood a chance to
win; and, at least, he had need for time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Upon the Laws of the Dalbergs,&rdquo; he replied,
raising his hand in salute; &ldquo;and under which, as
you all well know, I have been the Heir Presumptive
since my father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will accept them as final arbiter between
us?&rdquo; asked Armand quickly.</p>
<p>Ferdinand turned and looked at him fixedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the Crown, yes,&rdquo; he said very softly; and
not a man but understood the limitation and the
challenge.</p>
<p>And the Archduke smiled, and answered in a voice
even softer and more suave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be it&mdash;I will chance the rest.&rdquo; Then he
addressed the Council. &ldquo;His Excellency, the Prime
Minister, has the key to the box; with your permission
I will ask him to explain when and under what
circumstances he got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Count took care that Armand should lose
nothing in the telling, and when he had finished, he
drew out the queer little key, and holding it so
all could see looked at the two Dalbergs inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I unlock the box?&rdquo; he asked; and both
nodded.</p>
<p>But the key would enter only a little way; and
while the Count worked with it, Armand remembered
suddenly the unusual motion Frederick had used the
day he showed him the Laws.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Turn the bit sidewise and push down and in,&rdquo;
he said. And at once the key slipped into place and
the lock snapped open.</p>
<p>At the sound, the Ministers eagerly craned forward;
but the Count did not offer to lift the lid until
he received the Archduke&rsquo;s nod; then he slowly laid
it back, and leaning over peered inside. And he
peered so long, that Lotzen grew impatient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Laws, Epping, the Laws,&rdquo; he said sharply;
&ldquo;let us have them, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count looked at him and then at Armand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The box is empty,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<h2 id="c4">IV
<br /><span class="small">THE PRESUMPTION SHIFTS</span></h2>
<p>Into the silence of amazement that ensued, came
the Duke&rsquo;s sneering laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, surely, you didn&rsquo;t think to find it
otherwise!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>His insinuation was so apparent that the Archduke
turned upon him instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a coward, Ferdinand of Lotzen,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Speak plainly; do you mean to charge me
with having removed the Book from the box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke bowed. &ldquo;Just that, Your Royal Highness,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;just that, since you must have it&mdash;you
Americans are so blunt of speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand leaned forward. &ldquo;The only way to deal
with a liar,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;is to put him where he
can&rsquo;t lie out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ferdinand shrugged his shoulders deprecatingly.
&ldquo;You play it very cleverly, cousin mine, but the
logic of elimination is against you. I assume you
will not accuse our dear dead master of having hid
the Laws; and since his decease, the key, you admit,
has been with only you and His Excellency, the
Prime Minister. I assume also you will acquit
Count Epping&mdash;I am quite sure I will&mdash;and so
we come back to&mdash;you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>The Archduke had long ago learned that in an
encounter with Lotzen it was the smiling face that
served him best; so he controlled his anger and
turned to the Ministers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Highness overlooks the logic of opportunity,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I was not in the Summer Palace,
since the King&rsquo;s death, until this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ferdinand laughed again. &ldquo;Naturally not;
you&rsquo;re not such a bungler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baron Steuben, who had been pulling thoughtfully
at his beard, eyeing first one and then another,
here broke in, addressing Armand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would Your Highness care to tell us when you
last saw the Book of Laws?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall gladly answer any question the Council
may ask. The only time I ever saw either Book or
box was the day the King offered me my inheritance
as the heir of Hugo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And once again came Lotzen&rsquo;s sneering interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you could instruct Count Epping just
how to manipulate the key:&mdash;&lsquo;turn the bit sidewise
and push down and in.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Retz half closed his eyes and smiled; Epping&rsquo;s
lips grew tighter; Duval and Marquand frowned;
Steuben, with a last fierce tug at his beard, relapsed
into silence.</p>
<p>But Armand met the issue squarely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my word against your inference,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I am quite content to let the Council choose. They,
too, have seen that key used but once, and yet I
venture that a year hence they also will remember
the peculiar motion it requires.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are much more likely to remember your
ready wit and clever tongue,&rdquo; Lotzen retorted.</p>
<p>The Archduke turned from him to the Council.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lords,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is small profit to you
in these personal recriminations. The question is,
who is King of Valeria, Ferdinand of Lotzen or
myself&mdash;and as only the Book of Laws can answer,
I ask that you, yourselves, search King Frederick&rsquo;s
apartments and interrogate his particular attendants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Epping arose. &ldquo;Will the Minister of
Justice aid in the search,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;and also Your
Royal Highness?&rdquo; addressing Lotzen.</p>
<p>The latter smiled. &ldquo;No; I thank you&mdash;what is
the good in searching for something that isn&rsquo;t
there!&rdquo;&mdash;then he turned upon Armand. &ldquo;I assume
you brought the box here,&rdquo; pointing to the table,
&ldquo;and that you found it in the vault, where it is
always kept&mdash;may I inquire how you got into the
vault?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the door,&rdquo; said the Archduke dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you know the combination&mdash;something
the King never told even me. Observe, my lords, the
logic of opportunity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Armand shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
do not know the combination.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>And Lotzen, seeing suddenly the pit that yawned
for him if he pursued farther, simply smiled incredulously
and turned away.</p>
<p>The old Count, however, saw it too, and had no
mind to let the opportunity slip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who opened the door?&rdquo; he asked bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her Royal Highness the Princess,&rdquo; said the
Archduke.</p>
<p>And Epping nodded in undisguised satisfaction;
while Ferdinand of Lotzen, sauntering nonchalantly
over to the nearest window, cursed him under his
breath for a meddler and a fool.</p>
<p>As the Duke had predicted, the search of the
King&rsquo;s apartments and the vault proved barren; and
then, his particular servants and such attendants as
were in the Palace were summoned and examined,
and also without result; indeed none of them remembered
having seen either box or Book&mdash;save one:
Adolph, Frederick&rsquo;s valet. He said that, recently,
his master had spent many hours in the evenings
studying the Laws, going through them with great
care, making notations and marking certain pages
with slips of paper; that no one else was ever
present at such times, and once, when he had unthinkingly
approached the desk, the King had
angrily bade him leave the room. Asked when he
had last seen the Book, he answered the fourth
day before His Majesty&rsquo;s demise; which, he added,
he felt sure was also the last time it had been used;
but admitting, frankly, when pressed by the Archduke,
that his only reason for so thinking was that
he had not seen it in that interval.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, as to that, my dear cousin,&rdquo; said Lotzen
from the window, the instant the valet had gone, &ldquo;I
am altogether willing to admit, and for the Council
to assume, that the Book was safely in the box and
the box safely in the vault when Frederick died.
Don&rsquo;t try to obscure the point at issue&mdash;what we
want to know is what you have&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;what
has happened to it since that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand waited with polite condescension until the
Duke had finished, then he ignored him and addressed
the Council.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lords,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are confronted by a
most unpleasant duty: Valeria must have a King,
and you must choose him, either Ferdinand of
Lotzen or myself. We cannot wait until the Laws
are found. I claim the throne by presumptive right;
he, by a right admitted to be subordinate to mine.
In the absence of the decrees my title is paramount,
and the royal dignity falls on me. If the Laws be
recovered, and under them I am not King, I will
abdicate, instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lotzen had come back to the table and resumed
his favorite attitude of leaning over the back of a
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charming, indeed, charming!&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Make me King,
and if the Laws unmake me I will abdicate when they are
recovered&mdash;when&mdash;they&mdash;are&mdash;recovered!
Do you fancy, messieurs, they would ever be recovered?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>Count Epping saved the Archduke the necessity
of answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness&rsquo; argument,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;is
predicated on the hypothesis that the Archduke
Armand has possession of the Book of Laws and is
concealing it because it would, if exhibited, prove
him ineligible to the Throne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admirably stated!&rdquo; said Lotzen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Epping went on, &ldquo;you cannot expect the
Council to accept any such hypothesis&rdquo;&mdash;and all
the Ministers nodded&mdash;&ldquo;we must assume that neither
you nor the Archduke knows aught of the Book, and
whatever action we do take must be, upon the distinct
condition, agreed to, here and now, by you both, that
when the Laws are found&mdash;as found they surely will
be&mdash;the Succession shall be determined instantly by
them. Are you willing,&rdquo;&mdash;addressing Lotzen&mdash;&ldquo;that
the Council, of which you are one, shall settle
it, pending the recovery of the Laws?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not,&rdquo; said the Duke abruptly; &ldquo;but
pending election by the House of Nobles, I am content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister watched the Duke meditatively
for a moment, then turned to the Archduke
inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am content, even as His Highness of Lotzen,&rdquo;
said Armand; he saw where the play was leading,
and the other&rsquo;s next move, and he was not minded
to balk him; there was likely to be a surprise at
the end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>The Count faced the Council.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter is before you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Having
in view the Laws and circumstances, as we know
them, to whom shall we confide the government?&rdquo;
and with a bland smile, he looked at the Minister of
Justice&mdash;who, as the junior member, would have to
vote first.</p>
<p>Retz stirred uneasily and glanced furtively at
Lotzen. He was not inclined to go so rapidly, or,
at least, so openly. Had he apprehended any such
proceeding he would have remained at home, ill, and
let his dear colleagues bear the unpleasant burdens.
It was an appalling dilemma. He wanted to vote
for Lotzen&mdash;yet he was sure that Armand would be
chosen. If he voted for Armand, he would bear the
Duke&rsquo;s everlasting enmity, and, in the end, the Laws
or the Nobles might give him the Crown. If he
voted for Lotzen, and Armand were chosen, he lifted
himself out of the Council, and ended his career if
eventually the American won. He ran his eye
around the table and caught the smile on every face,
and mentally he consigned them all to death and
perdition. Then he heard Epping&rsquo;s voice again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are waiting, Monsieur le Baron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Lotzen came to his relief&mdash;quite unintentionally;
he alone had not noted Retz&rsquo;s embarrassment,
having been reading a paper he had taken
from his pocket-book.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, if you please,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I take
it, that what may give the Archduke Armand preference
over me in his claim for the Crown, is the
presumptive right of the eldest male. If, however,
by the Laws, he is specifically deprived of that right
and made ineligible to the Crown, save under two
conditions, I assume the presumption would be reversed,
and he would be disqualified for the Succession
until he had proved, by the Laws themselves,
his rehabilitation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were addressed to Epping, and the
answer was prompt and to the point:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your proposition begs the situation,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;it needs the Laws to prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke laughed. &ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t. I will
prove it out of the mouth of the Archduke Armand
himself.&rdquo; He held up the paper. &ldquo;Here is a copy
of the Great Henry&rsquo;s decree reinstating Hugo. I
made it months ago, being, it would seem, wiser
than I knew. With the first portion the Council is
already familiar, Frederick having quoted it to you
the day the Archduke Armand was presented; but
of the last sentence, unfortunately, he made no mention;
and it is that which governs now. His Royal
Highness is fully acquainted with the original, and
if my copy is not accurate he can make denial&mdash;nay,
further, if he deny, I will accept whatever correction
he may offer.... Surely, cousin,
that is fair and honest&mdash;shall I read it&mdash;or will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Armand smiled indifferently. &ldquo;You can do it
with much better effect,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you have all of it or only the last sentence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lotzen smiled maliciously. &ldquo;The sweet as well as
the bitter, cousin mine, with the bitter at the end.&rdquo;
Then he tossed the paper across to Epping. &ldquo;Will
Your Excellency read it?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>With a glance at the Archduke for permission, the
Count complied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Section one hundred twenty-fifth&mdash;Whereas,
we have learned that our second son, Hugo, hath
served with much honour in the American Army
under General Washington, and hath, since the termination
of hostilities, married into a good family in
one of the said American States, called Maryland,
and hath assumed residence therein; and whereas
he hath never sought aid from us nor sued for
pardon; Now, therefore, in recognition of his valour
and self reliance and true Dalberg independence, it
is decreed, that Section one hundred twenty-one,
supra, be annulled; and Hugo&rsquo;s name is hereby
reinstated on the Family Roll in its proper place,
the same as though never stricken therefrom. And
it is further decreed that the marriage of Hugo
and the marriage of his descendants shall be deemed
lawful, the same as though their respective consorts
were of the Blood Royal. The titles conferred upon
Hugo shall, however, remain in abeyance until
claimed anew by him or by his right heir male&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And now, my lords, attend,&rdquo; Lotzen cut in.
&ldquo;Your pardon, Monsieur le Comte, pray proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>The old man paused a moment in rebuke, then
resumed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nor shall the latter be eligible to the Crown
unless hereinafter specifically decreed so to be&mdash;or
in event of a vacancy in the royal dignity without
such decree having been so made, then, by special
Act of the House of Nobles.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;&lsquo;Henry III., Rex.</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;&lsquo;Ye 17th of September, A.D. 1785.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prime Minister slowly put down the paper,
and every one looked at the Archduke&mdash;what would
be his answer? There was no doubt that Lotzen had
scored heavily, so heavily, indeed, that Retz made no
effort to restrain his smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does His Royal Highness deny the correctness
of the copy and that the decree is as read?&rdquo; the
Duke asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never seen the decree,&rdquo; said Armand,
&ldquo;and my&mdash;pray have the courtesy, sir,&rdquo; (as Lotzen
laughed and shrugged his shoulders) &ldquo;to wait until
I&rsquo;ve finished&mdash;and my only knowledge of it is from
hearing it read by the King, the day he offered me
my inheritance; but if my recollection be accurate,
the decree is as you have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a flash the situation had become reversed, and
it was now Armand against whom the presumption
ran; and it was he, and not Ferdinand, who required
the Laws to prove his claim.</p>
<p>A heavy silence followed. Then into the stillness
cut the Duke&rsquo;s taunting laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exit the American,&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;Vale the
foreign pretender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was, he knew, into Armand&rsquo;s most vulnerable
spot and, like the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i>, he had saved it
until last; yet, to his astonishment, it brought only
a contemptuous smile and an ignoring stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Grace of Lotzen seems to have discovered a
mare&rsquo;s nest,&rdquo; said Armand. &ldquo;The decree that is
required to make me eligible to the Crown and to
restore me to my proper place in the Line of Succession
was executed by Frederick the Fourth the
night before he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And once again came Lotzen&rsquo;s taunting laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The night <i>after</i> he died, you mean, cousin,&rdquo; he
exclaimed.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister turned upon him with a
frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Royal Highness will permit me to suggest,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;the propriety, under the circumstances,
of neither you nor the Archduke addressing
each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lotzen, discerning that the Council was of
the same mind, nodded easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cry pardon,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Your Excellency
is quite right&mdash;but you will understand, I deny the
existence of this suspiciously timely decree. As to
it, at least, there is no presumption of execution&mdash;the
Laws alone can prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count turned to the Archduke. &ldquo;Your
Highness has seen the decree?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the King tell you it was executed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not&mdash;but he told another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that other&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the Princess Royal,&rdquo; said the Archduke.</p>
<p>The Count paused a moment to give the situation
emphasis&mdash;and Lotzen, chagrin and anger consuming
him, yet smiling and unabashed, drew out a
cigarette and carefully lit it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Her Highness would honor the
Council with the facts?&rdquo; Epping asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will acquaint her with your desires,&rdquo; said
Armand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<h2 id="c5">V
<br /><span class="small">THE COMPROMISE</span></h2>
<p>The Princess&rsquo; suite was across the corridor from
the King&rsquo;s, and in a moment the Archduke was
with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty!&rdquo; she cried, and curtsied.</p>
<p>He raised her quickly. &ldquo;Not yet, sweetheart,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;not yet&mdash;and, may be, never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stepped back and regarded him in puzzled
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are jesting, dear,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;surely, you
are jesting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head and went toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the decree&mdash;the decree!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
again stepping back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Laws have disappeared,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the box
is empty and the Book cannot be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In bewildered amazement she let him lead her to a
chair, and listened, frowning and impatient, to his
story. Only once did she interrupt&mdash;when he mentioned
the Duke&rsquo;s unexpected entrance&mdash;then she
struck her hand sharply on the table at her side.
&ldquo;Lotzen! Oh, Lotzen!&rdquo; she cried, and with such
threatening vehemence that Armand looked at her
in sudden wonder.</p>
<p>At the end, she sprang up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;Come; take me to
the Council&mdash;I can at least assure they won&rsquo;t make
Lotzen king,&rdquo; and seizing his hand she made for the
door.</p>
<p>He slipped his arm around her waist and detained
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure, Dehra, you ought to mix in this
unfortunate squabble?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Is it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned upon him sharply. &ldquo;Squabble! Do
you call a contest for Valeria&rsquo;s Throne a squabble?&rdquo;&mdash;then
suddenly she smiled&mdash;that sweet, adorable
smile she ever had for him. &ldquo;Be very careful, sir,
or I shall tumble both you and Lotzen aside, and
take the Throne myself.... Now, will you
escort me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her thoughtfully, then smiled and
patted her cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Your Majesty,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;come, and
claim your Crown; it&rsquo;s yours by right, and I shall
be the first to swear allegiance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the first to rebel, dear,&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>They entered the council chamber through the
King&rsquo;s cabinet, and as the Princess halted a moment
in the doorway the Ministers sprang to their feet
and stood waiting, while Ferdinand of Lotzen advanced
and bowed low; not offering, however, to
take her hand, fearing it would not be given, and
having no notion to risk a snub in such company.</p>
<p>To his astonishment, Dehra extended her hand
and let him kiss it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You come on a sad errand, cousin,&rdquo; she said....
&ldquo;I would you were still in Lotzenia.&rdquo;
The words were so innocently fitting, yet the double
meaning was so deliberate.</p>
<p>The Duke slowly straightened, discomfiture and
amusement struggling for control, while Armand
smiled openly and the Ministers looked away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Princess passed on serenely to
the table and took the chair at its head. Then,
led by Count Epping, the Council came forward
and made obeisance. She received them with just
that touch of dignified sadness which the circumstances
demanded, and which, with men, a woman
must measure with the exactness of fine gold. And
with it there was the low, sweet voice, the winning
graciousness, and the dazzling smile&mdash;now softened
just a trifle&mdash;that never yet had failed to
conquer, and that had made her the toast of the
Army and the pride of the Nation. And Armand
had watched her, with glistening eyes, as one after
another she sent the Ministers back to their places,
bound to her chariot wheels; captive and content.</p>
<p>And Ferdinand of Lotzen, seeing, understood;
and for the first time he realized fully what her aid
meant to his rival, and how little chance he had to
win, save with the Laws. And straightway the last
faint scruple perished, and he set his cold heart
against her, as well. Henceforth, for him, there was
but one object in life&mdash;the Crown of his ancestors,
and for all who interfered there would be neither
consideration nor mercy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>And the Princess&rsquo; eye, resting for an instant on
his face, read something of his mind, and with a lift
of the chin and a careless smile she turned to the
Council.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lords,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;His Royal Highness has
acquainted me with your desires, and I am glad indeed
if I can serve you. His Majesty, the night
before he died, executed the decree necessary to make
the Archduke Armand his successor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw the decree?&rdquo; Count Epping asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I did not, but what I know is this. Late
that night I went into the King&rsquo;s library; he was
sitting at his desk, with the Book of Laws open
before him and a pen in his hand. He was blotting
a page as I entered. &lsquo;You have made Armand&rsquo;s
decree?&rsquo; I cried, and went to his side to read it;
but he laughed and closed the Book, saying: &lsquo;You
may see it to-morrow, child, after I have told
Armand.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he did not tell you the words of the decree,&rdquo;
the Count asked, after a pause, &ldquo;neither then nor
the following day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess closed her eyes and lowered her head.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;no&mdash;I never saw my father
again&mdash;alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a distressing silence&mdash;then Armand
spoke:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Council will understand that His Majesty
had no opportunity to tell me of the decree. I was
with him yesterday only at the review; naturally
he would not speak of it then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that was, I suppose, the last time you saw
the Book of Laws?&rdquo; Epping asked, addressing the
Princess, who had recovered her composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;it was lying on the table when I left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask Your Highness,&rdquo; said Steuben,
&ldquo;why, when you saw that His Majesty had been
writing in the Book of Laws, you assumed, instantly,
that it was &lsquo;Armand&rsquo;s decree,&rsquo; as you put it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know, my lords,&rdquo; she responded,
&ldquo;that it is rare, indeed, that a new law is made for
the Dalbergs, there have been but five in the last
hundred years, and the making is ever due to some
extraordinary circumstance, which is known, of
course, to all the family. We had been anticipating
the decree, restoring Armand to his rightful
place in the Line of Succession as Hugo&rsquo;s heir, and
hence it was very natural to assume it was that
which His Majesty had written.&rdquo; She paused, and,
for an instant, her glance strayed to the Duke of
Lotzen. &ldquo;But it was particularly natural,&rdquo; she
went on, &ldquo;inasmuch as the King had mentioned
the matter to me twice within the week, the last
time that very morning, and referring to it as
&lsquo;Armand&rsquo;s decree.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steuben nodded. &ldquo;I am satisfied,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and
Duval and Marquand nodded.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister turned to Ferdinand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We would be glad to hear Your Royal Highness,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>The Duke laughed softly in sneering amusement.
He was still standing behind his chair, and now he
tilted it forward and leaned across it, his arms folded
on the rail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small chance have I against such a Portia,&rdquo; he
answered. &ldquo;Yet I would remind the Council that,
where kingdoms are concerned, a pretty woman is a
dangerous advocate to follow&mdash;and thrice dangerous
when against her is the written Law and with her
only&mdash;conjecture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our cousin of Lotzen does not mean to question
my veracity?&rdquo; the Princess asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your veracity?&mdash;never, I assure you&mdash;only
your inferences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, sir, what other inferences can be
drawn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders and turned to the Prime
Minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reiterate my claim to the Crown,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;and the only Law of the Dalbergs that is before
you confirms it. I cannot conceive that the Royal
Council of Valeria will arrogate to itself the right to
annul a decree of Henry the Third.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Highness of Lotzen misses the point,&rdquo; said
Armand. &ldquo;I do not ask the Council to annul that
decree, but only to assume from Her Royal Highness&rsquo;
story that it was duly and legally annulled by
Frederick the Fourth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, my lords, exactly,&rdquo; the Duke retorted;
&ldquo;inference against fact&mdash;guesses against an admitted
Law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Armand made the play he had had in mind
since it was certain that the Book of Laws was lost.
He was standing behind the Princess&rsquo; chair&mdash;now
he stepped forward and addressed the Duke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are putting a grievous
burden on the Ministers in obliging them to choose
between us, with the proofs seemingly so strong
on either side. It is not fair to them to drive
them to the embarrassment nor to the misfortune
that would attend a mistake. There ought to
be no doubt in the mind of the Nation as to the title
of the king; he who occupies the Throne should
have his tenure unquestioned; and such cannot be
if the one of us who is to-day made king is liable to
be displaced to-morrow by the other. Besides, as I
understand Henry the Third&rsquo;s decree, the Council
has no jurisdiction except by our agreement. You
assert the decree of eligibility was not made by Frederick.
If that be true, then, there being &lsquo;a vacancy
in the royal dignity without such decree being made,&rsquo;
it is for the House of Nobles to enact my eligibility
and so give me the Crown, or to refuse and so give
it to you. Therefore, I propose that for the space
of a year, or pending the recovery meanwhile of the
Book of Laws, we let the question of succession remain
in abeyance. If, at the end of the year, the
Book has not been found, then the House of Nobles
shall choose between us. And as in the interval there
must be some one in supreme authority, let Her
Royal Highness be proclaimed Regent of Valeria.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Never before had there been such instant, open
and cordial unanimity among the Ministers of the
Royal Council. Here was a complete solution of the
vexing problem, and one, moreover, that would relieve
them of a most undesirable duty. Baron
Retz&rsquo;s smile was positively gleeful, and the others
nodded enthusiastically and turned to the Duke
expectantly.</p>
<p>And Lotzen saw that he was losing&mdash;and with
rage and hatred in his heart, but with calm face and
voice softer even than usual, he made his last play,
knowing well that though it might not win, it would
at least work a sweet revenge upon his rival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An admirable compromise for you, cousin
mine,&rdquo; he laughed; &ldquo;and clever, very clever&mdash;you
and Dehra are to be married on the twenty-seventh.
What difference, think you, will there be between
you as King and you as Consort of the Princess
Regent?&rdquo; Then he faced the Council and flung his
last card: &ldquo;Otherwise, my lords,&rdquo; he said with
suave frankness, &ldquo;I would willingly accept His
Highness&rsquo; proposition&mdash;or I will accept it, if it is
engaged that the wedding shall abide the termination
of the Regency ... how say you, cousin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again had the Duke turned the situation by
his devilish cleverness, and Armand&rsquo;s fingers itched
to take him by the throat and choke the life out of
him; and Lotzen, reading something of this in his
eyes, grinned malevolently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How say you, cousin?&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;how say
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke deliberately gave him his back.
&ldquo;My lords,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it seems the Duke of Lotzen
would force you to the choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the old Count did not intend to forego the
compromise. He wanted Armand for king because
Armand was, <i>de facto</i>, the Head of the House, because
he was convinced the decree had been executed,
because it would make Dehra the Queen, and because
he despised Lotzen. With the Princess as Regent,
there would be ample means to swing the Nobles to
the Archduke, and to prepare the public for his
accession. Of course, it would also give Lotzen time
to campaign, yet he who fights the government has
a rough road to travel, and usually falls by the way.
Leastwise, the Count was very ready to adventure it.
But he needed aid now; and aid that could come
from but one quarter and which he could seek only
by indirection&mdash;Dehra alone controlled the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The compromise suggested is admirable,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and though there is force in the objection
made to it, yet, my lord,&rdquo; (addressing Lotzen) &ldquo;you
cannot expect the Archduke to accept your amendment.
It is not for the man to change the wedding
day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>The Princess sat up sharply. When Armand had
suggested her as Regent she had leaned forward to
decline, but catching Epping&rsquo;s eye she had read an
almost imperious order to wait; and having full faith
in him, she had obeyed. Now she saw what he
wanted; and though it was against her heart&rsquo;s desire
and a cheerless business, yet her own judgment told
her he was right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not for the man,&rdquo; the Count repeated, looking
at her hard, &ldquo;to change the wedding day, and
least of all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, monsieur,&rdquo; she broke in. &ldquo;It seems that
unwittingly I have been drawn into the situation,
and put in a position where I am obliged to speak.
Does the Royal Council approve this compromise,
and desire me to become Regent of Valeria?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count smiled in supreme satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can assure Your Highness we are of one mind
that, in this exigency, it is your duty to assume the
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess arose. &ldquo;Then, my lords,&rdquo; she said
gravely, &ldquo;I accept, hereby engaging that my wedding
shall abide the termination of the Regency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke made a gesture of protest, but
Dehra flashed him her subduing smile and shook her
head, and there was naught for him to do but to
smile back&mdash;and add one more to the score that,
some day, Ferdinand of Lotzen would have to settle.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister looked at the Duke with a
bland smile of triumph, and then at Armand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it your joint wish,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that we ratify
the stipulation and proclaim the Regency?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said the Archduke; but Lotzen only
bowed.</p>
<p>Count Epping drew his sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valeria hails the Princess Dehra as Regent,&rdquo; he
cried. It was the ancient formula changed to fit the
occasion.</p>
<p>And this time Armand&rsquo;s blade rang with the
others across the table, and his voice joined exultantly
in the answer that echoed through the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hail the Princess Regent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the sound died Ferdinand of Lotzen stepped
forward and bent knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God save Your Royal Highness!&rdquo; he said, and
again Dehra gave him her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And grant me strength,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said the Count gravely. &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Lotzen who broke the stillness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Your Highness&rsquo; permission I will withdraw,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;there are pressing personal affairs
which demand my presence elsewhere.&rdquo; He turned
to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, cousin,&rdquo; said she&mdash;then to the
Prime Minister: &ldquo;Will the Council need His Highness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the same gracious manner, the same
soft voice, and yet, in those few words, she warned
them all that there was now a Regent in Valeria&mdash;and
a Dalberg regent, too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing now but to draw the Proclamation
for your signature,&rdquo; said the Count&mdash;&ldquo;the
other matters can abide for the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lotzen, at the Princess&rsquo; nod of permission,
went slowly from the room, his surprise still stronger
than his anger; though, in the end, it was the latter
that lingered and left its mark in his unforgiving
soul.</p>
<p>While the Count was drafting the Proclamation
made necessary by the changed conditions, the Princess
sat in silence, gazing in abstracted contemplation
through the window. Regent of Valeria! the
second the kingdom had known; the first had been a
woman, too&mdash;Eleanor, mother of the infant, Henry
the Third of glorious memory&mdash;yet, was it wise&mdash;was
it in fact her duty&mdash;her duty to her House; to
her beloved? Surely it was not to her pleasure&mdash;she
who had been happy in her nearing wedding day&mdash;her
lover placed next the Throne&mdash;his bright future
and her joy for it. And now&mdash;the wait&mdash;the struggle&mdash;the
obligation of right, of justice; the putting
off the woman, the putting on the ruler where
the woman interfered. Her father! she turned that
thought aside sharply&mdash;she had turned it aside many
times since yesterday, as he had bade her to do:&mdash;&ldquo;When
I go, child, do not grieve.&rdquo; Yet, when two
have been comrades for years it is not easy.</p>
<p>The Count ceased his writing and, laying aside the
pen, looked up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will it please Your Highness to sign?&rdquo; he
said quickly&mdash;he had little liking at any time for
a woman&rsquo;s reverie, and none at all when it was of
the sort he knew this reverie to be&mdash;and the woman
had work to do.</p>
<p>And Dehra, preoccupied though she was, had
missed nothing that was doing at the table, and she
let him know she understood him, by a smile and a
shake of her handsome head. It was not exactly a
reproof, and yet neither was it an encouragement to
do the like again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please read it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>It was very brief&mdash;reciting the death of Frederick
the Fourth, the disappearance of the Book of Laws,
the stipulation of the Archduke and the Duke relative
to the Succession remaining in abeyance, the
creation of a Regency during the inter-regnum and
the Princess&rsquo; acceptance of the office.</p>
<p>When he had done, she asked if there were any
suggestions, and none being offered, she signed it
and returned it to the Count. Immediately the
Council arose and she and Armand retired, by
the same way they had entered.</p>
<p>As they passed through the library, Dehra went
over to the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is where the King sat that last night,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and here the Book of Laws lay, and here was
the box. I can&rsquo;t imagine what he did with the Book&mdash;nor
why he removed it from the box&mdash;and the
box was in its usual place in the vault when I gave it
to you to take to the Council&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>A door latch clicked, and Adolph, the valet, came
in hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the Archduke, seeing he wished to
speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The box, my lord,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;you left it
in the council-chamber&mdash;is it to remain there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Princess&mdash;&ldquo;bring it here at once.&rdquo;
She went to the vault and opened it....
&ldquo;Put it on the shelf in the rear,&rdquo; she ordered, when
Adolph returned. He obeyed and gave her the
key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no need to lock it,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has a spring lock, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the
man. &ldquo;It snapped when I closed the lid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dehra nodded indifferently. &ldquo;So it has....
Shut the vault door.&rdquo; Then motioned to him in
dismissal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s of small consequence,&rdquo; she remarked to
Armand, as she gave the combination a twirl, &ldquo;the
box is of little use without the Book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she turned away, her glance fell on the big
portrait of her father that hung high on the opposite
wall&mdash;and of a sudden the reaction came, and
the tears started, and her lips twitched. She reached
out her hand appealingly to Armand. In silence, he
put his arm around her and led her quickly from
the room.</p>

<h2 id="c6">VI
<br /><span class="small">THE REWARD OF A MEDDLER</span></h2>
<p>When Ferdinand of Lotzen left the Council, he
passed leisurely down the corridor toward one of the
private exits. The pressing business that was demanding
his immediate attention seemed to bother
him no longer, and he even took the trouble to acknowledge
the salute of the guard who paced before
the main stairway; whereat the man stared after
him in unfeigned surprise, until the Duke, suddenly
looking back, caught him in the act&mdash;and with a
frown sent him to the about-face and the far end of
his beat.</p>
<p>So no one saw His Highness step quickly over and
try the door of the King&rsquo;s library, and, when it
opened to him&mdash;as he had anticipated it would, the
Princess having come that way to the Council&mdash;go in
and close it softly behind him. Dropping the lock,
he went to the door of the private cabinet (which
was between the library and the room used for the
Council meetings) and listened. Hearing nothing,
he opened it very cautiously and peered inside; no
one was there and he fixed the door a bit ajar, so as
to be warned if anyone entered from the Council.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>The library was a large room, paneled ceiling and
sides in wood painted an ivory white; the great, wide
windows were half hidden by the Gobelin blue tapestries
that hung in folds to the floor; heavy bookcases
of carved mahogany lined the walls; the furniture
was of the massive Empire style, but the desk
was a big, oblong, flat-topped affair that had been
made over Frederick&rsquo;s own design&mdash;and which more
than compensated in utility for what it lacked in
artistry. It pleased its owner and so fulfilled its
mission. It stood a little way back from the center
of the room, the great crystal chandelier above its
outer edge, and all the doors directly in focus of the
revolving chair behind it.</p>
<p>It was to this chair that the Duke went and began
hurriedly to go through the papers on the desk, yet
taking the utmost care not to disturb their arrangement,
and replacing them exactly as he found them.
Evidently whatever he was seeking was of the sort
that needed no examination to prove it, for he passed
over letters and written documents without a glance
at their contents. It was not on the desk and he
began on the drawers, none of which was locked.
One after another was searched without success, and
the Duke&rsquo;s brow went blacker and blacker, until, as
the last proved barren, he flung himself into the
chair, and again ran over the documents on top&mdash;and
again without finding what he sought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only a chance,&rdquo; he muttered, sending his
glance around the room, &ldquo;only a feeble chance;...
&lsquo;He was blotting a page as I entered,&rsquo;
was what she said ... and if it were a
fresh blotter it might tell the story.&rdquo; He went
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
over to the vault, the front of which was painted
white and paneled to correspond to the
walls, and tried the door.... &ldquo;Locked,
of course&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly he turned toward the King&rsquo;s cabinet,
listening; then sprang quickly behind one of the
window curtains; and its swaying had not ceased
when the Princess and Armand entered, on their
return from the Council.</p>
<p>Unseen, he was also unseeing; yet hearing, he had
little need for eyes&mdash;it was easy to picture all that
occurred:&mdash;Dehra&rsquo;s pointing out the positions of
the King, the Laws and the box; the entry of
Adolph; the opening of the vault; the valet&rsquo;s return
with the box; his dismissal; the locking again of the
vault. But what then happened always puzzled the
Duke&mdash;that it was something unexpected was proved
by the sudden silence, and pause, before either of
them moved, followed at once by the closing of the
corridor door.</p>
<p>He waited a moment, until he was sure they had
gone, then went to the desk. What had disturbed
the American and the Princess&mdash;why had their talk
ceased so abruptly&mdash;why did they wait, unmoving,
and then go out together and still unspeaking?...
Had they seen him?... Impossible;
even the window did not show through
the tapestry; and he had been against the wall....
His gloves&mdash;had he let them lie somewhere?...
no, they were drawn through
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
his sword belt.... He studied the desk
top&mdash;the floor&mdash;the chairs.... They told
him nothing;... and, yet, it was very
queer.... Had any part of him been exposed
beyond the curtain? He went back and got
behind it ... it completely covered him&mdash;and
as he stood there the cabinet door opened
and Adolph came in softly.</p>
<p>He glanced around quickly, then went straight to
the vault and began to turn the knob, while the
Duke, one eye just beyond the curtain&rsquo;s edge,
watched him curiously. Could it be that this servant
was familiar with the combination of the lock, that
only the King and Dehra were supposed to know!
If so ... the bolts shot back, the door
opened, and the valet disappeared in the vault. In
a moment he came out with the box; but Lotzen
did not see him, having drawn behind the curtain;
nor did he venture again to look out except when
assured that Adolph&rsquo;s back was toward him.</p>
<p>Placing the box on the desk, the valet laid back
the lid and with another furtive look around, went
swiftly across to the wall, where hung the big, life-sized
portrait of the King, the escutcheon, on the
top of the heavy gold frame, almost against the
ceiling. Under it was a tall, straight-backed chair,
with high arms; and, mounting on them, Adolph
reached behind the picture and, from the space between
it and the wall, drew out an ancient book,
leather-bound and metal-hinged:&mdash;the Laws of the
Dalbergs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>With a faint chuckle, he sprang down and started
toward the box; then stopped&mdash;the Book slipped
from his fingers&mdash;he gasped&mdash;his eyes widened in
terrified amazement&mdash;his face took on the gray pallor
of awful fear; for the Duke of Lotzen had emerged
from behind the window curtain and was coming
slowly toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem startled, Adolph,&rdquo; said the Duke, with
an amused smile, &ldquo;doubtless you thought you were
alone.&rdquo; He sat down in the revolving chair. &ldquo;May
I trouble you to give me the Book&mdash;the floor is
hardly the place for the Laws of the Dalbergs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The valet&rsquo;s composure had returned, in a measure,
at the tone of the other&rsquo;s voice, but his hand
still trembled as he picked up the Book and carried
it to the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Adolph,&rdquo; said Lotzen, &ldquo;thank you ...
you seem a trifle shaky, sit down and
rest&rdquo; (indicating a chair near by). &ldquo;I shall need
you presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He watched the man until he had obeyed, then
opened the Laws and turned quickly to the last
decree.</p>
<p>Across the page lay a fresh, white blotter, used
but twice, he noticed, as he turned it over. He had
come for this very bit of paper, that Dehra had
casually mentioned in her story to the Council&mdash;hoping
vaguely that the King had let it lie, and that
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
it had not been destroyed by the servants who cared
for the desk. He would have been amply satisfied
with the faint chance it might give him of guessing
the decree from the few words the mirror would
disclose. But, now, he had no need for guesses nor
mirrors; and with a light laugh he laid the blotter
aside. Surely, the Goddess of Fortune was with
him! And to Ferdinand of Lotzen this meant much;
for to him there was only one other Divinity, and
that other was a female, too.</p>
<p>Thrice he read Frederick&rsquo;s decree; first rapidly,
then slowly, then word by word, as it were.</p>
<p>And all the while Adolph watched him covertly, a
sly smile in his small, black eyes. He had quite recovered
from his fright&mdash;though he might be led to
pretend otherwise&mdash;indeed, now that he had time to
think, he could find no reason why the Duke should
punish him; rather did he deserve an ample reward
for having kept the Laws from the Council. In
fact, why should he not demand a reward, if it were
not offered?&mdash;demand it discreetly, to be sure, but
none the less demand it. And, as the Duke read,
and re-read, the reward piled higher, and visions of
Paris (it is strange how, under certain conditions,
the thoughts of a certain sort of people turn to
Paris as instinctively as the needle to the Pole)
danced before his eyes.... And presently
he forgot the Duke, and the Laws, and Dornlitz&mdash;he
was sitting at a little table along the Boulevard
des Italiens, an absinthe at his hand, a merry girl,
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
with sparkling eyes and perfumed hair, at his elbow,
a sensuous waltz song in his ears, and light,
and life, and love, and lingerie in every breath of
air....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreaming, Adolph,&rdquo; said Lotzen, &ldquo;dreaming?...
of what, pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Paris, my lord,&rdquo; he answered unthinkingly.</p>
<p>The Duke regarded him in frowning surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paris!&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;Paris! has everyone gone
Paris mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was of the Boulevards, my lord&mdash;the music
and the lights and the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; exclaimed Lotzen; &ldquo;to the devil
with your Paris and its Boulevards!...
How did this Book get behind that picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put it there, monsieur.&rdquo;&mdash;The reward was not
piled quite as high as he had fancied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hide it, monsieur&mdash;until I could replace it in
the box.&rdquo;&mdash;The reward was dwindling marvellously
fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you stole the Laws of the Dalbergs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adolph did not answer.... It was
queer how chilly the room had got. It had seemed
warm enough, a moment ago.</p>
<p>The Duke regarded him meditatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said presently; &ldquo;tell me how you
managed it. My time is short&mdash;speak up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>The valet slunk a furtive look at his face; it was
expressionlessly pitiless.&mdash;The reward had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness will believe me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe you, Adolph! surely&mdash;a valet never lies!
Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man gulped&mdash;ran his tongue over his lips&mdash;gulped
again&mdash;then began, his voice husky, full of
quavers and sudden stops; while the Duke, with
steady gaze and searching eye, drove him on as with
a lash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness heard my story to the Council,&rdquo;
said Adolph; &ldquo;all of it was true except as to the
last time I saw the Book of Laws.... I
happened to witness the scene between Her Royal
Highness and the King. It was just as she related
it, monsieur. When she had gone, His Majesty
sat, doing nothing&mdash;and presently he dropped
asleep.... I came to the room a number
of times, and always that Book stared at me, and
my curiosity as to the decree grew hotter every
minute. After a while, the King awoke and told
me to put the Book in the box and return it to its
place in the vault&mdash;then he went over to the sideboard
and poured out a drink.... Here,
monsieur, was my opportunity&mdash;I laid the Book
in the box and lowered the lid, but slipped in an
envelope to prevent it locking, then put it in the
vault&mdash;which the King himself closed. After he
had retired, I opened the vault and got out the
Book&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know the combination?&rdquo; the Duke
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By&mdash;by&mdash;watching the King, monsieur ...
I had picked up the numbers one by one ...
long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lotzen tossed him a bit of paper and a pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write out the combination,&rdquo; he ordered&mdash;and
smiled at the servant&rsquo;s trembling hand and labored
motions.... &ldquo;Thank you;&rdquo;&mdash;glancing at
the paper and dropping it carelessly in his pocket&mdash;&ldquo;proceed&mdash;you
had just got the Book out of the
vault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I was examining it, monsieur,&rdquo; Adolph
resumed, &ldquo;I thought I heard the King moving about
in his room. I sprang inside the vault, drew the
door shut, but not quite tight, and tried to put the
Book in the box. But I must have been nervous,
monsieur, for, in some way, I struck the lid and
knocked it down; and it locked, leaving the book in
my hand. I could not open the box&mdash;the only key
was under the King&rsquo;s pillow, on his watch chain.
What was to be done? I dared not try for it that
night; the King was too light a sleeper;&mdash;nor did I
dare leave the Book in the vault, there was no place
to conceal it, and he was sure to go in there in
the morning. What was to do, monsieur? I
listened&mdash;everything seemed quiet; I opened the
door very slowly&mdash;no one was in the room&mdash;I
stepped out, and the King&rsquo;s portrait confronted me&mdash;I
stared at it a moment, frightened as though it
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
were my master&mdash;then, of a sudden, I knew I had
found the hiding place, and I sprang up and put the
Book behind the picture.... And in the
morning, monsieur, I forgot the Book&mdash;forgot it
until His Majesty had gone to the city.&mdash;Then, in
desperation, I tried every key I could find&mdash;tried to
pick the lock&mdash;in vain.... I knew the
Archduke Armand was to dine here that evening, and
from what the King had said to the Princess I knew,
also, the Book would have to be in the box before
then. I felt, however, that I would have a good
chance at the key when my master dressed for dinner.
Then, my lord, came the awful news of his
death, and once again I forgot the Book&mdash;nor ever
thought of it, until I saw the Council gather&mdash;and
then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he threw up his hand, expressively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, now, what were you about to do?&rdquo; asked
Lotzen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put the Book in the box, monsieur, and return it
to its place in the vault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke looked at him in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clever, clever, indeed,&rdquo; he muttered.... &ldquo;I
thought you gave the key to Her Highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adolph smiled&mdash;his spirit was never long in
travail. &ldquo;I did, monsieur&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t need it;&mdash;and
it was a good play to give it up at once. Never
having had the key to the box, it could not be I who
replaced the Book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lotzen studied the little valet a bit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Clever,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;clever ...
quite too clever, I fear.&rdquo; He leaned across and
tried the closed lid of the box; it lifted to his hand&mdash;and
out on the desk dropped the little square
of folded paper that had held the lock just out of
catch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Altogether, too clever,&rdquo; he concluded, picking it
up and looking at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fixed that in the Council chamber,&rdquo; Adolph
explained; then he stared knowingly at the Duke&mdash;&ldquo;monsieur
was behind the curtain when I brought
back the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Decidedly, this fellow was not to Lotzen&rsquo;s liking.
He made no reply beyond a quick, sidelong glance,
drumming with his finger tips softly on his knee.
Then he turned to the desk and tapped the Book of
Laws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You read this, I suppose, Adolph?&rdquo; he remarked
indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;King Frederick&rsquo;s, you mean?&mdash;yes, my lord, I
did; but that is all&mdash;I had no time to read more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke nodded, his eyes on the Book.</p>
<p>The valet was becoming uneasy; he fidgeted in his
chair, locked and unlocked his hands, listened toward
all the doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he said, at length, &ldquo;we may be found
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lotzen closed the Book. &ldquo;True, Adolph, true,&rdquo;
he answered, getting up and stepping back. &ldquo;Put
the Laws in the box&mdash;don&rsquo;t let it lock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>The valet sprang to obey; and as he leaned across
the desk&mdash;his back to the Duke&mdash;and dropped the
Book into the box, Ferdinand of Lotzen whipped out
his sword, and, with the sure hand of the skilled
fencer, drove the rapier-like blade through the man&rsquo;s
heart.</p>
<p>Without cry or struggle, Adolph sank forward;
and the box locked, as the lid fell under him.</p>
<p>For a moment, the Duke held the body with his
sword; then he slowly drew out the blade and wiped
it on his handkerchief; while the dead man slipped
from the desk and crumpled on the floor.</p>
<p>Lotzen looked down at him and shrugged his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor fool,&rdquo; he muttered&mdash;&ldquo;why did you
read what didn&rsquo;t concern you!&rdquo;... He
stooped and turned the body on its face. &ldquo;No
blood!&mdash;a neat thrust, truly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">

<p class="center"><small>THE DEAD MAN SLIPPED FROM THE DESK.</small></p>
</div>
<p>He knew the room overlooked the King&rsquo;s private
gardens, and, going to a window, he cautiously
raised the sash. It was as he had thought:&mdash;below
was a thick hedge of box-wood, that grew to within
a foot of the palace wall, which at that point was
blank. Fortune was still his friend, it seemed; and,
with a smile, he carried the valet&rsquo;s body to the window
and&mdash;after a quick survey of the garden to
assure that no one was in sight&mdash;balanced it an
instant on the casement, then dropped it behind the
hedge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Drawing down the window he rearranged the curtains
and returned to the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as his eyes fell upon
the box&mdash;&ldquo;Locked!&mdash;the fool must have fallen on
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood looking at it, frowning in indecision. He
had intended to take the Book with him, trusting to
conceal it under his short cavalry cape&mdash;but the
box was impossible; not only was it considerably
larger than the Laws, but its weight was amazing
for its size.... Then he saw the open
vault, and what to do was plain&mdash;he would follow
the valet&rsquo;s plan. None now would look in the box,
and, for a time, the Book would be safer there than
with him; later, he could arrange to get it&mdash;he
knew the combination.... He laughed
cynically&mdash;it was a pretty game, and the pleasanter
because it would be played directly under the American&rsquo;s
eye.</p>
<p>He carried the box into the vault, closed and
locked the door, and, returning to the desk, put in
place the papers disarranged by the valet&rsquo;s fall.
Among them lay the blotter that had been in the
Book of Laws. He studied it a moment ...
made as though to tear it ... then folded
it and put it in the inside pocket of his jacket. A
last glance around the room assured him that everything
was as he had found it. With a satisfied
smile, he turned toward the corridor door, and his
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
eyes rested on the portrait of His late Majesty.
He stopped, and the smile changed to a sneer, and
doffing his cap he bowed mockingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My thanks, Sire, for dying so opportunely,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;may the devil keep you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<h2 id="c7">VII
<br /><span class="small">THE ARMISTICE OF MOURNING</span></h2>
<p>And so Frederick the Fourth of Valeria slept with
his fathers, and Dehra, his daughter, ruled, as
Regent, in his stead.</p>
<p>In the great crypt of the Cathedral, among the
other Dalbergs, they had laid him away, with all the
pomp and circumstance that befit a king&mdash;within,
the gorgeous uniforms and vestments, the chanting
priests, the floating incense; without, the boom of
cannon, the toll of bells, the solemn music of the
bands, the click of hoofs, the rumble of the caissons,
the tramp of many feet.</p>
<p>When it was all done, the visiting Princes hurried
away, the governmental machinery sped on, the
Capital took up its usual routine, and all that remained
externally to remind the people of a ruler
just and righteous, were the draped buildings and
the crape upon the troops. And, at the dead&rsquo;s own
express behest, even these had vanished on the fifteenth
day after his demise. &ldquo;Let the period of
mourning be limited strictly to a fortnight, both for
the Nation and my House,&rdquo; he had written, in his
own hand, as a codicil to his Testament; and the
Regent, with no shade of hesitation, had ordered it
as he wished. She knew it was Frederick&rsquo;s last kindness
to his subjects. A Court in sackcloth buries the
Capital in ashes, drives the tradesmen into insolvency,
and bores the Nobility well nigh into insanity
or revolt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>And as she ordered, so she did&mdash;though sadly and
regretfully&mdash;and, with a blessing upon her, the
Court resumed its accustomed life and garb, and
Dornlitz its gayety and pleasures. Yet Valeria was
sorry enough at Frederick&rsquo;s demise&mdash;sorrier far than
he would have believed it could be. At the best, a
King is of use, these days, only as a head for the
Government&mdash;and when the new head is capable and
popular, the old one is not missed for long.</p>
<p>As it was, the people had scarcely realized that
Frederick was dead when they were met with the
amazing Proclamation of Dehra&rsquo;s Regency; with the
result that usually follows when sorrow and joy
mingle, with joy mingling last.</p>
<p>In the interval, there had been no developments
as to the Book of Laws. The Duke of Lotzen had
observed the very strictest of mourning; not transgressing,
in the slightest particular, the most trivial
canon of propriety. He had remained practically
secluded in his big residence on the Alta Avenue,
appearing in public only at intervals. He had paid
his brief visit of condolence to the Princess and had
been greeted by her with calm and formal dignity.
He had made his call of ceremony upon the Governor
of Dornlitz&mdash;the Archduke Armand&mdash;and had been
received by him in the presence of half his Staff.
Then, after the funeral of the dead King, he had
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
settled down to wait the termination of the two
weeks of enforced inactivity. He could well afford,
for that long, to dally with the future. So he subdued
his natural indisposition to quiet and orderly
living, and sternly bade Bigler and the others do
likewise, telling them that the search for the Laws
and the removal of the American could abide for
the time.</p>
<p>But never a word did he speak to them of having
seen the Book and what Frederick had written the
night before he died.</p>
<p>Sometime before midnight, of the day that
Adolph, the valet, had been killed, the sergeant of
the guard, in making his rounds, saw a man skulking
in the private garden. At the order to stand,
the fellow had dashed away, and, seemingly unharmed
by the shot sent after him, he leaped the low
wall into the park, where among the trees and
bushes, he had little difficulty in escaping. The
matter was duly reported to the officer of the day
and an entry made of it, but as such occurrences
were rather frequent in the park, due sometimes to
petty pilferers from the town, and sometimes to soldiers
out without pass, it received no special attention,
beyond a cursory inspection of the locality the
following morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>Two days later, Adolph&rsquo;s body was discovered by
a gardener who was clipping the hedge; and then it
was remembered that the valet had not been seen
since the morning after Frederick&rsquo;s death. No one
had given him a thought&mdash;in truth, no one cared
anything about him. Like most of his class under
such circumstances, he had won the cordial hatred of
every one about the Court&mdash;a spoiled, impudent and
lying knave. Busy with the royal funeral, and the
great crowds it brought to the Capital, the police
gave the matter scant regard&mdash;the fellow was
known to them as a night prowler and a frequenter
of questionable resorts, and to have had numerous
escapades with married women; and the autopsy indicating
he had been dead at least thirty-six hours,
they had promptly ascribed the death to the skulker
shot at by the sergeant. There was no other clue to
work on, so, after a perfunctory search, they
shrugged it over among the other unsolved. What
was the use of bothering about a valet, any way!
Besides, it was a case to let alone, unless special
orders came from higher powers.</p>
<p>So they saw to it that the affair was entirely suppressed&mdash;such
happenings around royal palaces are
not for the public&mdash;and the information was casually
given out that the King&rsquo;s valet was so distressed,
by his royal master&rsquo;s death, he found it quite
impossible to remain in Dornlitz, and had returned
to France.</p>
<p>Once again, had the fickle Goddess smiled upon the
Duke of Lotzen, still captivated, doubtless, by the
very debonairness of his villainy and his steady gambler&rsquo;s
nerve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>And all unwittingly the Archduke Armand had
played directly into Lotzen&rsquo;s hands. Out of consideration
for the Princess, he had insisted that they
forget the Book of Laws until the period of mourning
were passed, and Dehra, against her better judgment,
had consented, though only upon condition
that they two should first make a thorough search of
her father&rsquo;s apartments, which they did the following
morning; she even climbing up and looking behind
the large pictures&mdash;much to Armand&rsquo;s amusement;
he asking what would be the King&rsquo;s object in
concealing the Book in such a place; and she retorting
that, as there was no reason at all for concealing
it, the unreasonable place was the most likely.</p>
<p>And in that she was very right; for the box itself
was now the most unreasonable place, yet even her
woman&rsquo;s fancy stopped short of it.</p>
<p>The period of official mourning expired on the
twentieth, and on the twenty-first, the Princess telephoned
to the Archduke to ride out to the Palace for
luncheon that day, and to bring the American Ambassador
with him&mdash;unless Mr. Courtney would
object to being with Helen Radnor&mdash;and that the
day being very warm they would be served under the
trees near the sun dial, below the marble terrace&mdash;and
that he and Courtney should join them there&mdash;and
that Helen was with her now. And Armand
had laughed and readily promised for them both.</p>
<p>As he hung up the receiver, Colonel Bernheim
stood in the doorway, and he nodded for him to
come in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>Bernheim saluted and crossing to the desk put
down a small package, about as large as one&rsquo;s fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here is the steel vest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke leaned back and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that as naturally as though it were my
cap or gloves,&rdquo; he commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not, sir&mdash;Ferdinand of Lotzen is in
Dornlitz, and the truce is ended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truce of mourning&mdash;you were quite safe
so long as it lasted; Moore and I made sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Colonel, you surprise me,&rdquo; said Armand.
&ldquo;How did you make sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By having some one buy Bigler plenty of wine,
at the Club&mdash;and then putting together stray words
he let slip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke shook his head in mock reproof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Moore are a wonderful pair,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You think for me more than I think for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile touched Bernheim&rsquo;s stern mouth and impassive
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to, Your Highness,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think at all; you leave it to Lotzen.&rdquo;
He pushed the package a little nearer&mdash;&ldquo;You will
wear it, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand took it, and, cutting the wrapper, shook
out the wonderful steel vest, that had saved his life
at the Vierle Masque when, from across the hedge,
the assassin&rsquo;s dagger had sought his heart. It was,
truly, a marvellous bit of craftsmanship; pliable as
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
silk and scarcely more bulky, the tiny steel links so
cunningly joined they had the appearance of
dark gray cloth. He bent and twisted it in admiring
contemplation. Verily, those armorers of old Milan
understood their art&mdash;never could modern hand have
forged and knit so perfect a garment. He found the
mark on the back, where the bravo&rsquo;s weapon struck&mdash;only
a scratch, so faint it was almost indistinguishable,
yet the blow had sent him plunging on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It served you well that night,&rdquo; said Bernheim.</p>
<p>The Archduke smiled. &ldquo;And as its owner always
does;&rdquo; he smiled&mdash;and the old Aide bowed&mdash;&ldquo;but
there is no Masque to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every night, now, is a Masque for Lotzen&mdash;and
every day, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven, man! you wouldn&rsquo;t have me wear this
constantly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not in bed;&rdquo; then seriously&mdash;&ldquo;but at all
other times, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand pushed the vest back on the desk and
frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it come to this, then&mdash;that my life isn&rsquo;t
safe here&mdash;nor in my house, nor on the street! Is
this civilization or savagery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernheim shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;neither&mdash;it&rsquo;s Hell. It&rsquo;s
always Hell where Lotzen plays. Surely, sir, you
have not forgot the past.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;but that was a Masque, and assassination
went with the costumes and the atmosphere; yet
now, in Dornlitz of the twentieth century&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
bring myself to believe ... why don&rsquo;t
you threaten me with poison or a bomb?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poison is possible, but not a bomb&mdash;it is not neat
enough for Lotzen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand looked at him in puzzled amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I see&mdash;he murders artistically&mdash;he
doesn&rsquo;t like a mess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so, sir; and the most artistic and least
messy is a neat hole through the heart....
You will wear the vest, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke&rsquo;s glance wandered to the window&mdash;electric
cars were speeding down the avenue&mdash;an
automobile whizzed by&mdash;and another&mdash;and another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;look! isn&rsquo;t it absurd to talk of
steel vests!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernheim shook his head. &ldquo;Lotzen does not belong
yonder&mdash;he is a remnant of the Middle Ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not; so no armor for me, my dear
Bernheim&mdash;I&rsquo;ll keep my eyes open and take my
chances. I don&rsquo;t believe the crown of Valeria will be
the reward of an assassin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disappointment shone in the Aide&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m something of a Fatalist, myself, sir,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;but I wouldn&rsquo;t play with a tiger after I had
goaded him to fury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand smiled. &ldquo;The case isn&rsquo;t exactly parallel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not exactly:&mdash;the tiger <i>might</i> not kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>The Archduke picked up the letter knife and
slowly cut lines on the blotter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not go into the tiger&rsquo;s cage,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any cage&mdash;the beast is at large.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Colonel; this fellow Lotzen has got
on your nerves. I thought you hadn&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pity of it is, sir, that he hasn&rsquo;t got on
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when he does,&rdquo; said Armand kindly, &ldquo;will
be time enough for the chain-mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernheim took the vest and deliberately laid it on
the blotter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the sake of those who love you, my lord,&rdquo;
he said&mdash;&ldquo;and&rdquo;&mdash;turning to a picture of the Princess,
which hung on the opposite wall, and saluting&mdash;&ldquo;for
her whom we all serve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke looked at the picture in silence for
a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send the vest to the Epsau,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I will
wear it&mdash;sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Bernheim knew he had to be satisfied with the
sometimes&mdash;though as even that was more than he
had dared to hope for, he was well content.</p>
<p>The Archduke and the American Ambassador met
by appointment at the outer gate of the City, and
as the former had been delayed, they rode at speed
to the Summer Palace. It was the first time they
had been together, informally, since the King&rsquo;s
death, but beyond the usual friendly greeting and
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
an occasional word en route there was no conversation.
There was much that Armand wished to discuss
with his friend, but this was not the place for it&mdash;it
needed a quiet room and the other aids to serious
consultation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a word with you, Dick, before you go
back to town,&rdquo; he remarked, as they dismounted.</p>
<p>And Courtney nodded comprehendingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As many as you wish, my boy,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But the Princess also wanted a word with Courtney;
she knew his keen insight into motives and men;
his calm judicialness of judgment; his critical analysis
of facts, and, most important of all, his influence
with Armand, and she desired his counsel and his
aid. She had not forgot the part he had played in
the recent past; that but for him there would be no
Archduke Armand; that, indeed, it was this quiet
diplomat whom she had to thank for the happiest
days of her life, and the happy prospect for the days
to come; and, but for whom, there would be to her
only the memory of that ride in the forest with the
American Captain Smith; and Ferdinand of Lotzen
would be King; and she&mdash;she might even be his
Queen&mdash;and have yet to learn his vileness and his
villainy.</p>
<p>All this she knew, and her heart warmed to Courtney
as now it warmed to none other save Armand
himself. And that very morning, as the two men
crossed the terrace and came toward them, she had
told Lady Helen Radnor, with the smiling frankness
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
of a comrade, that if she sent this man away, no act
in all her life would equal it in folly; then without
waiting for an answer she had gone to greet her
guests.</p>
<p>Now, when the luncheon was ended, she dismissed
the servants and turned to Courtney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you do something for Armand?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I have already done him service
enough?&rdquo; he said, looking at her with a significant
smile&mdash;&ldquo;more than he deserves or can ever appreciate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, may be you have,&rdquo; she smiled, catching his
humor, &ldquo;so do this for me&mdash;help me to make him
King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She leaned a bit nearer. &ldquo;Keep him firm for his
birthright; don&rsquo;t let him fling it aside in disgust, if
the struggle drags out, for long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney nodded. &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
you need have no concern; you yourself will keep
him firm&mdash;it&rsquo;s the only way he can make you
Queen.&rdquo; He paused and tapped his cigarette meditatively
against his glass. &ldquo;You think there isn&rsquo;t
any doubt as to the decree in his favor?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None&mdash;absolutely none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then all you have to do is to find the Book&mdash;that
shouldn&rsquo;t be so very difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough; it shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;but it will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem very positive,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s intuition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney smiled. &ldquo;Which isn&rsquo;t infallible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you try to prove that?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Will
you help us find the Book?&rdquo; And without waiting
for his answer she turned to the Archduke. &ldquo;Armand,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;tell Mr. Courtney what we know
as to the Laws; I want his advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand laughed. &ldquo;I fancy he already knows it,
my dear&mdash;it&rsquo;s his business to know things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s also particularly his business,&rdquo; she
retorted, &ldquo;never to betray that he knows&mdash;therefore,
we must tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear with him, Your Highness,&rdquo; said Courtney&mdash;&ldquo;I
assure you he will learn in time....
Meanwhile, Monsieur le Prince, I&rsquo;m all attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand leaned over to Lady Helen. &ldquo;His manners
are rather crass,&rdquo; he remarked, in a confidential
whisper, &ldquo;but he really means well.&rdquo; Then he
pushed the cigarettes across to Courtney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a fresh one, old chap; the story may be a
bit long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<h2 id="c8">VIII
<br /><span class="small">INFERENCE OR FACT</span></h2>
<p>Through the story Courtney sat with half closed
eyes, pulling at his gray imperial, the unlighted
cigarette between his lips. With the main facts he
was already familiar, as was every Embassy in
Dornlitz, but much of the small details were new to
him; and at the end, for a while, he was silent, fitting
the incidents together in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you care to tell me what the police make of
it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, as usual,&rdquo; Armand answered. &ldquo;Their
intelligence doesn&rsquo;t run beyond a hidden panel, and
sounding every wall and floor in the Palace; they
scorn any theory but that His Majesty concealed
the Book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is perfectly absurd,&rdquo; Dehra added;
&ldquo;why should he conceal it, with the box and the
vault at hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you make them take another lead?&rdquo;
Lady Helen asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m sick of them and their ways.&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
sent them away&mdash;and away they stay; in another
day there wouldn&rsquo;t have been a wall in the Palace.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She told the officer in charge the only way
he could ever find the Book was not to search for
it,&rdquo; Armand laughed. &ldquo;And then gave him a grade
in rank to salve the words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt, sir!&rdquo; the Princess exclaimed.
&ldquo;And remember I can&rsquo;t give <i>you</i> a grade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was any one with the King after you left him
that night?&rdquo; Courtney asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only Adolph, the valet,&rdquo; Dehra replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
quite sure he would receive no one at that hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did Adolph say as to the Book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he hadn&rsquo;t seen it for four days prior to
Frederick&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; said Armand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; the Princess asked
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told the Council.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he deliberately deceived you; he saw
it the night I did&mdash;the last night;&mdash;he came to
the door just after the King spoke of Armand&rsquo;s
decree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney struck a match and carefully lit the
cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Adolph?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has gone back to France, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney sent a quick, inquiring look at Armand,
which the latter missed, having turned toward Lady
Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I remember,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;there was a
stray line about him in the paper&mdash;grief and so
forth. At the time, I inferred he had been banished
by the police, for some reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can have him back,&rdquo; she interjected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>The Archduke looked around. &ldquo;Adolph is dead,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;His body was found behind the hedge
under the King&rsquo;s library windows three days after
Frederick&rsquo;s demise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his return to France?&rdquo; Dehra exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fiction of your police, doubtless,&rdquo; said Courtney
dryly; &ldquo;they are very clever.... He
was&mdash;killed, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Park, the night the King died; a dagger
wound in the heart,&rdquo; the Archduke explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that to be the fact; or is it the
police theory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know anything&mdash;indeed, it was only
yesterday I learned of it and sent for the papers
in the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the&mdash;killer, I assume, has not been apprehended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally not,&rdquo; said Armand; and proceeded
to explain the matter as the police viewed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think, now?&rdquo; Dehra demanded,
at the end.</p>
<p>A bit of a smile crept into Courtney&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the only circumstance
which relieves the police from utter imbecility is
their not knowing that the valet had lied to the
Royal Council as to the Book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess&rsquo; finger tips began to tap the table,
and the little wrinkle showed between her eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, my dear, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; laughed Armand; &ldquo;you
can&rsquo;t give the entire Bureau a grade in rank&mdash;and
besides, they are not to blame. I called the Chief
down hard yesterday, only to have him tell me it
was the ancient and rigid custom never, except by
special order, to investigate a crime that touched
the royal household, nor to follow any clue which
led inside the Palace. And I apologized&mdash;and instantly
abolished the custom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were specially ordered to search for the
Book of Laws,&rdquo; the Princess insisted; &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t
that lead them to Adolph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under their theory Adolph had nothing to do
with the Book,&rdquo; said Courtney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; the Archduke remarked; &ldquo;and between
their rotten theories and customs the business
has been sadly bungled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their fatal fallacy,&rdquo; said Courtney, &ldquo;was, it
seems to me, in assuming that no one but His
Majesty and Her Highness could open the vault.&mdash;I
have no doubt the valet had discovered the combination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the box,&rdquo; Dehra objected; &ldquo;it was locked
when I got it, and Adolph could not have had the
key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might have had a duplicate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; said Armand; &ldquo;it is a trick lock
with a most complicated arrangement, and to make
a duplicate would have required the original key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, however that may be is not essential,&rdquo;
said Courtney; &ldquo;the fact remains that, between
eleven o&rsquo;clock of one night and ten o&rsquo;clock of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
second day thereafter, the Book disappeared; and
the last time it was seen, to our knowledge, it was
lying under the King&rsquo;s own hand, on the table
in his library, with the open box beside it; and
that the latter was found, closed and locked and
empty, in its place in the vault, while the most
thorough search for the Book has been ineffectual
except, it seems, to prove that it is not in the
Palace. We can safely assume that His Majesty
did not hide it; hence he returned it to its place;
and whoever took it, got it out of a locked box in a
locked vault. For this, Adolph had the best opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what possible motive?&rdquo; the Princess exclaimed.</p>
<p>Courtney smiled. &ldquo;If I could tell you that, we
would be far toward finding the Book; yet he had
a motive&mdash;his lie to the Council proves it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think he stole the Laws?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Courtney sent a smoke cloud shooting upward
and watched it fade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that if Adolph didn&rsquo;t steal
them, he knows who did; his lie can bear no other
construction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his death?&rdquo; the Archduke asked.</p>
<p>Courtney watched another smoke ring and made
no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; insisted Armand; &ldquo;answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I stop with the lie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Indeed, I
can&rsquo;t get beyond it. The valet would have but one reason
for stealing the Book&mdash;to sell it to&mdash;Some-one,
who would have every reason to conceal or
even to destroy it. Every logical inference points
to this Some-one; and yet, for once, logic seems
to be at fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the Duke of Lotzen?&rdquo; said the Princess.</p>
<p>Courtney smiled, but made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pardon,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but at least you can
tell us why the logic is at fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the actual facts are otherwise.
As Armand knows, I like to play with
mystery, and when I may help a friend I like it
all the more. The logical solution of the matter,
in view of the decree, is a knowing valet, and a
ready buyer; yet the latter was not in Dornlitz,
when the Book was stolen, nor has my most careful
investigation disclosed any communication, by
Adolph, with him or his friends. On the contrary,
the evidence is absolutely conclusive against it;
and hence acquits the Some-one of having had any
hand in the theft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew, then, of Adolph&rsquo;s death?&rdquo; Armand
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;though not all the details as you related
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke smiled; there were very few
details missed when Courtney started an investigation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your argument, Richard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is based
upon the hypothesis that Adolph is the thief, which
appears most probable; yet did your examination
suggest no other solution?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely none&mdash;and, more peculiar still, I
was unable to find the slightest trace of the valet
outside the Palace, between the time he left the
Council and the discovery of his dead body behind
the hedge&mdash;though you and Her Highness saw
him in the library after the Council adjourned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is the last time I ever saw him,&rdquo; said
Dehra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And more than that,&rdquo; Armand added, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
the last time any one saw him in the Palace; I had
that matter looked into yesterday. The Council rose
about noon and afterward not a servant nor soldier
so much as laid eyes on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there something particularly significant
in the place where Adolph was found?&rdquo; the Princess
asked. &ldquo;Mightn&rsquo;t he have been killed in the
library and then, from the window, the body
dropped behind the hedge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney&rsquo;s hand went to his imperial reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very reasonable and a very likely explanation,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;and the nature of the wound
supports it; it was a noiseless assassination;&mdash;but,
again, that eliminates the Some-one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said the Archduke; &ldquo;he left the
Council before it adjourned, to return at once to
town.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>did</i> he return at once?&rdquo; Dehra persisted.
&ldquo;Mightn&rsquo;t he have remained and killed Adolph&mdash;some
how, some way&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, but mightn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand shook his head. &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I looked into that too, and there seems to
be no doubt Lotzen was in Dornlitz before one
o&rsquo;clock; and every moment of his time, until Adolph
was found, has been accounted for; so, even assuming
he didn&rsquo;t leave the Palace immediately, he
would have had to kill the valet within half an
hour after we saw him in the library; and that,
under all the conditions, is utterly incredible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s incredible where Lotzen is concerned,&rdquo;
she answered. &ldquo;So let us assume he did
kill Adolph, in the King&rsquo;s library, during that very
half hour between noon and twelve-thirty, and
answer me this: <i>Why</i> did he kill him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either to get the Book of Laws or because
Adolph knew too much concerning it,&rdquo; said Armand,
smiling at her earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly; and, therefore, Lotzen either has the
Book or he knows where it is.... Am I not
right?&rdquo; she demanded, turning to Courtney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly, Your Highness&mdash;according to
your premises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t admit the premises?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;they are too improbable&mdash;and the
facts are against them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, facts!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;facts! I don&rsquo;t
care a rap for facts. Lotzen killed Adolph and
Lotzen has the Book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney looked at her curiously&mdash;the idea was
preposterous, naturally, but the very arbitrariness
of her conclusions was softened by her earnestness
and evident faith in their truth. It was, of course,
just another case of woman&rsquo;s intuition, that begged
every question and tore logic into tatters; yet,
sometimes, he had known it to guess truly, despite
the most adverse facts&mdash;might it be that here was
just another such guess?</p>
<p>The table stood back a little way among the
trees, and was hidden from the Palace by the hedge
of rhododendron, that flanked the roadway where it
swept around the great marble pergola; and so
they did not see the man in undress cavalry uniform,
who came slowly along the terrace, and, descending
the steps, took the path leading to the sun-dial.
At it he paused, with desultory interest seemingly,
to read the shadow; bending over, the while, to
blow away the dust.</p>
<p>As he did so, the Princess saw him, through a
rift in the hedge. First she frowned, then a quizzical
smile settled on her lips, and she glanced again
at Courtney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you still doubt?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Courtney, preoccupied, looked at her a moment
without replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;being a man and intuitionless,
I still must doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>At that moment, the officer passed the hedge and
they all saw him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cousin!&rdquo; the Princess called,&mdash;&ldquo;cousin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke of Lotzen faced about sharply, then
doffed cap and approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness spoke?&rdquo; he said, bowing.</p>
<p>Dehra leaned on the table, her chin in her hand,
and studied him a bit, while the others wondered,
and Armand&rsquo;s anger rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have just asserted that
you killed Adolph and have the Book of Laws&mdash;is
it not the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Helen gasped; Armand half rose from
his chair; even Courtney&rsquo;s studied immobility of
countenance was not impervious to his surprise.</p>
<p>The Duke alone met the situation with perfect
imperturbability. He neither started, frowned, nor
changed expression in the slightest; the pleasant
smile, that was on his lips, lingered unabated, while
the hand that rested on his sword hilt was as steady
as the cold, blue eyes which gave back the Princess&rsquo;
gaze. Then, gradually, the smile broadened, creeping
slowly upward, until it touched the cold blue
eyes, though warming them not a whit; presently,
he laughed, gently, and with just a trace of jeer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not for a subject to contradict the Regent
of Valeria,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and with a bow and a salute
he turned languidly away.</p>
<p>And the Princess did not stop him, but in silence,
chin still on hand, she watched him out of sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<h2 id="c9">IX
<br /><span class="small">THE RECKLESS GAME</span></h2>
<p>The Princess was the first to speak. &ldquo;Tell me,
Your Excellency,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you admit my
premises, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you, yourself, quite as sure of them, as
you were?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&mdash;sure! I&rsquo;m absolutely sure&mdash;I saw the
truth in his eyes&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you, Armand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;I never saw
truth anywhere in Lotzen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he were innocent, why should he plead
guilty?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if guilty, why should he admit it?&rdquo; the
Archduke asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because in this case the truth is more misleading
than a lie&mdash;he had no notion we would believe
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a very extraordinary man,&rdquo; observed
Courtney; &ldquo;his mental processes are beyond belief.
Your question was the most amazing I ever heard,
and should have been instantly decisive of his guilt
or innocence; instead, it has only clouded the
matter deeper for you and cleared it completely for
him. Your cards are exposed&mdash;his are still stacked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not stacked to me,&rdquo; said Dehra; &ldquo;he
is guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, in that aspect, he has deliberately asked
you what you&rsquo;re going to do about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get the Book&mdash;for Adolph I
don&rsquo;t care&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad he killed the little beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how,&rdquo; said Armand, &ldquo;are we to get the
Book? No ordinary means will suffice. Imprisonment
would only make a martyr of him and
strengthen him enormously with the Nobles and the
people; and banishment is absurd; he may be the
King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he has the Book, he would welcome banishment,&rdquo;
said Courtney; &ldquo;it would relieve him of
your espionage. But, Your Highness, let me ask,
why should he have it now? Armand admitted
to the Council he is ineligible without King Frederick&rsquo;s
decree, so why would Lotzen preserve that
decree? The Book is not essential to <i>his</i> title.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess shook her head incredulously.
&ldquo;Ferdinand of Lotzen is a knave but I won&rsquo;t believe
that of him.... A Dalberg destroy
the Dalberg Laws! Inconceivable!&mdash;oh, inconceivable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, between the Crown of Valeria and the Book
of Laws, you think he would chose the latter; and
hand the Crown to Armand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would conceal the Laws&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t destroy
them,&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
<p>The Archduke reached over and took her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your mistake is in
rating Lotzen a Dalberg&mdash;he isn&rsquo;t; he&rsquo;s a vicious
mongrel; if he had the Book, you can rest assured
he destroyed it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>But she shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your facts proved him innocent;&rdquo; she smiled,
&ldquo;and so they don&rsquo;t appeal to me to-day. I&rsquo;m
as sure he won&rsquo;t destroy the Laws as I am that he
killed Adolph; what troubles me is how to recover
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a year&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to wait a year for your crowning,
Sire,&rdquo; she broke in. &ldquo;Nor half a year,
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled indulgently, and pressing lightly the
small fingers that still lay in his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little Kingmaker,&rdquo; he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;not I; Mr. Courtney is
your Warwick and Valeria&rsquo;s benefactor&mdash;he saved
us from Lotzen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, your work is not finished, old man,&rdquo; the
Archduke remarked; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a lot of saving to be
done, I fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney nodded rather gravely; he was quite
of the same mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warwick will hold to the work,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;and aid you all he may; but, for the immediate
present, I would advise that we sit tight and give
the enemy a chance to blunder. And in the meantime,
Armand, I suggest you change the combinations
on all the vaults here, and at the Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was done ten days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Book isn&rsquo;t in any vault,&rdquo; the Princess
remarked; &ldquo;they all have been thoroughly
searched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But something else may be in them, which
will be needed&mdash;one can never know,&rdquo; the Ambassador
answered. &ldquo;Leastwise, it won&rsquo;t hamper
us, and may hamper Lotzen&mdash;or some one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a wise precaution,&rdquo; the Archduke
added&mdash;&ldquo;the vault in the King&rsquo;s library, both here
and at the Castle, is filled with records and other
valuables, and upon both I changed the combinations
myself&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t trust it to a workman, who
could be found and bribed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was this change of combination that the
Duke of Lotzen had discovered that afternoon.</p>
<p>At the Archduke&rsquo;s firm insistence, Colonel
Moore, his junior Aide, had been detached from his
staff and assigned as Adjutant to the Regent; and
a portion of the King&rsquo;s suite, including his library,
allotted to him for quarters. This, also, was at
the Archduke&rsquo;s personal order&mdash;he, himself, might
not be there always to guard Dehra, so he gave
her the gallant Irishman, with the best sword in
the Kingdom and a heart as true as his sword.
Lotzen&rsquo;s bravos and his blandishment would be alike
powerless against him.</p>
<p>And the Duke, when he saw the order, smiled
in quiet satisfaction; and Bigler chuckled and read
it to Rosen at the Club&mdash;&ldquo;Thank Heaven we shan&rsquo;t
have the other damned foreigner to contend with
when we go after the American,&rdquo; he had said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>But when the Duke learned who occupied the library,
he cursed Moore and the luck that had put
him there&mdash;with the Book in the vault, and to be
got, and none but him to get it. For no one, not
even his closest associates, might know he had
found it&mdash;he could not trust even their loyalty
against the fetish of the Laws. So it was for him
alone to obtain it; and now the task&mdash;delicate
enough at best&mdash;had become almost impossible for
one man. Under every precedent, the King&rsquo;s
suite should have remained unoccupied, awaiting
his successor; but, instead, this Irishman; this fellow
with the quickest sword and surest eye in the
Army; this devoted follower of the American, and,
after him, the one man in Valeria whom he hated
the fiercest and feared even more; he was&mdash;though
thank God he did not know it!&mdash;guarding the Book
for his master.</p>
<p>It was, in truth, the first faint frown of his
Goddess, but Lotzen was too good a gambler to
flout her at the loss of a single turn. It meant
either a little more careful play or a little more
recklessness. And, on the whole, the recklessness
was rather more appealing than the care. If he
could not easily recover the Book, he could, at
least, adventure leaving it where it was&mdash;and let
the Regent&rsquo;s Adjutant guard it for him, too.
And he smiled his cold smile&mdash;and longed to make
a second Adolph of the Irishman, knowing well
that he, skillful fencer though he was, could never
reach Moore&rsquo;s heart save from the rear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>And that day, he had thought to take a reconnoissance,
and he had come to the Summer Palace,
trusting for an opportunity to gain admission to
the library, to open the vault. There was a possibility
that the King&rsquo;s effects had been removed from
it, and the box might also have been taken; and,
if so, it might be lying in some room, quite unguarded.
Yet he deluded himself little on that
score; the chance was too slight even to consider
seriously; there was really no occasion for emptying
the vault; on the contrary, Moore&rsquo;s presence
was the very best reason for leaving it untouched.
Nevertheless, it was well enough to make sure.</p>
<p>And here again luck bent to him. As he
turned the corner of the corridor at the end
farthest from the King&rsquo;s suite, Colonel Moore came
out and hurried down the stairway opposite, without
a glance aside.</p>
<p>Lotzen smiled, and went on to the library door&mdash;and
smiled still more broadly when he saw it was
open wide. Really, the thing was getting too easy!
He stopped and tapped lightly on the jamb with
his sword hilt&mdash;then stepped in and glanced quickly
around. The shades were half drawn, but there
was enough light for him to see that the room was
empty. Going swiftly to the vault, he whirled the
knob through the combination that Adolph had
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
given him, dropped it at the final number and
seized the handle.... The bolts refused
to move. With a frown, he spun the knob again;
and again they stood firm. A third time he tried,
carefully and slowly, not overrunning the marks by
the shade of a hair&mdash;and still the bolts stayed fixed.</p>
<p>With a muttered curse he stepped back, and from
the paper in his pocket verified the formula he had
used&mdash;though he knew he had made no mistake....
Could the valet have lied&mdash;have given
him a wrong combination&mdash;have actually played
him for a fool to his very face!... Impossible&mdash;quite
impossible&mdash;he could recognize fear
when he saw it; and no servant ever lied adroitly
under such terror as had gripped Adolph at that
moment. He stared at the vault and at the paper
... and, then, of a sudden, he understood&mdash;the
combination had been changed....
Why&mdash;by whom, did not matter now. Enough,
that behind that iron door the Book was surely
lying, and he powerless to obtain it....
Well, so be it&mdash;he must chance the risk; the reckless
game had been forced upon him by his enemies,
and he would play it out. They did not imagine
the Book was in the box&mdash;they would seek it elsewhere&mdash;and
the American would lead in the seeking&mdash;on&mdash;on&mdash;on
to Lotzenia, and the castle on the
mountain, high above the foaming Dreer&mdash;and
then!... A fell smile crossed his face,
and his eyes narrowed malevolently&mdash;there would
be no need for the Book, when they came back to
Dornlitz.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>As he stepped into the corridor, the door opposite,
in the Princess&rsquo; suite, opened and Mademoiselle
d&rsquo;Essold&eacute; came out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness!&rdquo; she said, dropping him a bit
of a curtsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lady!&rdquo; he answered, bowing over her hand;
then motioned behind him. &ldquo;Who occupies his
Majesty&rsquo;s apartments?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Adjutant to Her Royal Highness,&rdquo; she
answered, knowing well he knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I quite forgot. Colonel
Moore has pleasant quarters,&rdquo; and he smiled.</p>
<p>His inference was too evident to miss. She was
of the Regent&rsquo;s Household and Moore was her most
persistent suitor. She made no pretense to conceal
her displeasure, though she echoed his laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very pleasant,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;yet they
won&rsquo;t be his for long&mdash;he but holds them for
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the other?&rdquo; maliciously driving her to
the choice between the Archduke and himself.</p>
<p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There could be but one, my lord,&rdquo; she answered,
looking at him with calm directness.</p>
<p>He laughed. &ldquo;May be we do not guess alike;
and I fear me, when <i>my</i> other comes, the dashing
Colonel will have to make a far move&mdash;beyond the
border.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>The blue eyes snapped. &ldquo;I can well believe Your
Highness,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;When you move in,
Colonel Moore would scorn to stay this side the
border.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elise d&rsquo;Essold&eacute; never forgot the look that came
in Lotzen&rsquo;s eyes. It was, she said afterwards to
the Regent, as though he had actually struck her in
the face. And, for a little while, he did not speak.
Then as she drew back into the room, he bowed,
his hand upon his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My thanks, my lady, my thanks for your
candor,&rdquo; his voice soft and very kind&mdash;&ldquo;I shall
see to it that your Colonel does not go alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small danger,&rdquo; she replied, as she slowly closed
the door, &ldquo;Your Highness has been seeing to that
with fine success, these many years&mdash;<i>au revoir, mon
Prince</i>,&rdquo; and the latch clicked between them.</p>
<p>With a shrug, the Duke turned away. What
a vixen she was!&mdash;and how very sure Dehra must
be of the American&rsquo;s succession, when one of her
Household would venture to flout Ferdinand of
Lotzen to his face. His mouth hardened. Damn
the woman who played with statecraft&mdash;who meddled
with the things she knew nothing of&mdash;who
would impose a foreigner upon an ancient Kingdom,
just because he was her lover. Damn the
whole tribe&mdash;they were fit only to play with
clothes, and to serve man&rsquo;s idle moment....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>The rattle of a sword and click of spurs sounded
on the stairway, and the Regent&rsquo;s Adjutant turned
the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Colonel, well met!&rdquo; said Lotzen briskly,
as Moore came to attention and salute; &ldquo;I took
the liberty, as I passed your quarters, of looking
at His late Majesty&rsquo;s portrait; I wish to have a
copy made&mdash;the door was open, so I assumed I
might go in,&rdquo; and with a pleasant smile and nod
he passed on&mdash;then stopped. &ldquo;My congratulations
on your promotion&mdash;though as the smartest soldier
in the army it belonged to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moore looked after him thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What particularly fine bit of deviltry are you
up to now,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;and what were you
really doing in the library?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half way down the corridor Moore met Elise
d&rsquo;Essold&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whither away, my lady, whither away?&rdquo; he
asked, sweeping the floor with his cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not your lady,&rdquo; she answered, making
to pass by, but smiling sidelong at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Egad, I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t tell me that so
often&mdash;have some regard for my poor heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tossed her head. &ldquo;Your heart, indeed!
which heart? An Irishman has a hundred and a
different girl for every one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Irishman has a million hearts&mdash;and the
same girl for them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put the tip of her parasol to the wall, and
leaned lightly against it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And how many hearts has she?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He shook his head sadly. &ldquo;None&mdash;none&mdash;not
the faintest trace of one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bent further over, and tightened the bow
of blue ribbon on the staff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be you&rsquo;re not the one to find it,&rdquo; she
smiled&mdash;&ldquo;another man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and the merry eyes
glinted gaily through the long lashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m the man&mdash;and she knows it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little laugh rippled forth&mdash;&ldquo;And does she
know, also, your stupendous self sufficiency?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she knows that, too&mdash;and likes me just
the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which would seem to be very little&mdash;as it
should be.... My parasol if you please,
I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kept his hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little witch,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
why I let you walk upon me so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The saucy mouth drooped at the corners. &ldquo;Nor I
why I walk&mdash;the way is surely very stony....
My parasol, I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced up and down the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said seriously, &ldquo;I believe
that hat is so big I could kiss you, and no one
see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped the sun-shade and sprang back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe you could&mdash;and I believe you
actually would&mdash;but you shan&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>He opened the parasol, and drew the circle close
behind his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not quite so large as your hat,&rdquo; he went
on, &ldquo;but I think, if you don&rsquo;t struggle too much,
I can manage to hold it properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went slowly toward her&mdash;she retreated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she commanded;... &ldquo;cease
this foolishness ... my parasol;...
I&rsquo;m going....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;are you crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head and came on.</p>
<p>She was on the stairway now&mdash;a glance:&mdash;no
one was below her. She lifted her skirts with both
hands, and backed down the steps, smiling up at
him the while, tantalizingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; she said, as he halted at the top;
&ldquo;I need the parasol; come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little devil,&rdquo; he laughed; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tempt
me once too often.... Here, take your
sun-shade&mdash;I may have need of it another time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Merci&mdash;amant, merci</i>,&rdquo; she inflected softly,
then flung him a kiss from her finger tips&mdash;&ldquo;and
you take that&mdash;I won&rsquo;t need it another time&mdash;and,
if I do, I&rsquo;ve others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many others?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She faced about, and raising the parasol swung
it between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A million&mdash;for your hearts,&rdquo; she answered, and
ran quickly down the steps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Meanwhile the Duke of Lotzen, passing along
the lower corridor, had caught, in a mirror, the
reflection of the scene on the stairs, and had paused
to watch it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty picture, Mademoiselle; truly, a pretty
picture,&rdquo; he said, as they met; &ldquo;and most charming
from the rear&mdash;and below&mdash;oh! most charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her cheeks and brow went red as flame, as she
caught his meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You vile peeper,&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;doubtless,
you&rsquo;re an experienced judge,&rdquo; and dropping the
parasol in his face, nor caring that the silk struck
him, she hurried by.</p>
<p>The Duke looked after her contemplatively.
Really, this girl was worth while&mdash;he must take
a hand in the Irishman&rsquo;s game&mdash;that hair, those
eyes, that walk, that figure&mdash;oh, decidedly, she was
quite worth while.</p>
<p>With an evil little laugh, he put her out of his
mind, for the moment, and turned toward the terrace
and to business. He had learned of the alfresco
luncheon near the pergola, and he appreciated
that there was the place to make the first
move in his new plot.</p>
<p>Yet when, from the sun-dial, as he feigned to
study it, he saw the Princess, through the rhododendrons&mdash;with
the American across the table from
her, where he himself ought to have been; and
watched her lavish upon Armand the adorable smile
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
that should have been his; and knew, afresh, that,
come what may, the glorious woman yonder was
lost to him forever&mdash;his anger welled so high he
dared not risk a meeting, lest in his rage he wreck
his cause completely. So he braced his shoulders
against the fierce desire that tugged him toward
them, and went on, giving no glance aside.</p>
<p>Then the Princess called him; and when the
only voice able, hitherto, to touch a soft chord in
his heart, struck now a jarring dissonance, the
fury passed; and again he was the man of cold,
calm hate and ruthless purpose. So he turned
aside, and to his enemies&mdash;her and the foreigner&mdash;deliberating
how to make his play quickly, yet
naturally and with seeming inadvertence. The
faintest blunder would be fatal with Courtney
watching; Armand he despised.</p>
<p>And at Dehra&rsquo;s sudden question, he had almost
laughed aloud&mdash;was it always to be so easy! But
he bound his face to his part, and made his answer,
and went his way; whistling softly, and all unknowingly,
a little song, that a slender, sinuous
woman, with raven hair and dead-white cheek, had
sung to him in the North.</p>
<p>And when, presently, it came to him whose the
song was, and where he had heard it, he laughed
gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An omen!&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;an omen! On to
Lotzenia&mdash;and a dead Archduke.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<h2 id="c10">X
<br /><span class="small">A QUESTION OF VENEER</span></h2>
<p>The Archduke Armand tossed the end of his
fourth cigar into the grate and looked at the big
clock in the corner. It was only a bit after eleven,
and that was, he knew by experience, the blush of
the evening at the American Embassy, where there
were no women-folk to repress the youngsters nor
to necessitate the closing of the house at conventional
hours. Courtney had only bachelors in his
official family; and he housed them all with him in
the big residence on Alta Avenue, and gave them
free rein to a merry life, fully assured they would
not abuse the liberty; he had known every one of
them as boys, and their fathers before them.</p>
<p>The Archduke reached over and pressed a button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me a cap and a light cape,&rdquo; he said to
the servant;&mdash;&ldquo;and a stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man went out, and Armand crossed to a window
and drew aside the curtain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put them on a chair,&rdquo; he said without looking
around, as the door opened again. &ldquo;You may go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door closed. For a little while he watched
the gay street, stretching southward for half a
mile to the center of the city, where the lights
blazed variegatedly and brightest. The theatres
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
had tossed out their crowds, and below him the van
of the carriage column was hurrying homeward,
to the fashionable district out the Avenue, or to
the Hanging Garden above the Lake. Occasionally
a face, usually a woman&rsquo;s, would lean close to the
door and look at the Epsau curiously&mdash;it housed
the man who was likely to be King. And the man
smiled with half bitter cynicism, and wondered
what words followed the look, and who spoke them,
and to whom. Once, he recognized Count Epping&rsquo;s
lean visage, and in that carriage, at least, he felt
that the words were friendly; a moment later, the
snake eyes of Baron Retz went glittering by&mdash;but
never a glance did he turn aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little reptile,&rdquo; the Archduke muttered
aloud, &ldquo;you ought to crawl, not ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dropped the curtain and turned away&mdash;then
stopped, and his lips softened; and presently he
laughed. Just inside the door, and standing stiffly
at attention, was Colonel Bernheim, holding the
cape and cap and stick the servant had been sent
for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; Armand demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness desired these?&rdquo; said Bernheim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t send for you.&rdquo; The tone
was very kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are going out, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m on duty to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re excused&mdash;go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>The old soldier shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Armand, &ldquo;nonsense! I&rsquo;m
for only a short walk up the Avenue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go with you, sir,&rdquo; the Aide insisted.</p>
<p>The Archduke looked at him in some surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positively, Bernheim,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you keep
this up you will have nervous prostration. Quit
it, man, quit it.&rdquo; He flung on the cape, and taking
cap and cane went toward the door. &ldquo;Good
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Colonel stood aside, hand at the salute.
&ldquo;Your pardon, sir&mdash;but I must go with you&mdash;it
is the Regent&rsquo;s personal order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She telephoned me this evening always to see
that you had an escort, after dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke sat on the end of the writing-table
and laughed until the tears came&mdash;and even old
Bernheim condescended to emit, at intervals, a grim
sort of chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What hour are you to put me to bed, nurse?&rdquo;
Armand asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The orders did not run to that point, sir,&rdquo;&mdash;with
a louder chuckle&mdash;&ldquo;but I should say not later
than midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ve a few minutes&rsquo; grace, and I&rsquo;ll spend
them playing on the sidewalk, while you warm the
sheets and get the milk,&rdquo; and with another laugh
he went out. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the milk,&rdquo; he added
over his shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>Bernheim held open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not, sir,&rdquo; he said, and followed him.</p>
<p>At the street, Armand stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, Colonel?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The heels clicked together and the hand went up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the milk, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He recognized the futility of further opposition;
with the Regent&rsquo;s command to sustain him, Bernheim
would not be denied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, along, then,&rdquo; he ordered&mdash;&ldquo;and if they
have a cow at the American Embassy I&rsquo;ll set you
to milking it, or I&rsquo;m a sailor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old fellow answered with the faintest suggestion
of a grin.</p>
<p>All Dornlitz was familiar with the features of
the Great Henry, and so it was quite impossible
for the Archduke Armand to escape recognition&mdash;and
to-night, as he and Bernheim went out the
Avenue, the people made way for him with a respect
and deference that even he could not but
feel was honest and sincere, and of the quietly
enthusiastic sort that is most dependable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it look as though I had need for an escort?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at this moment,&rdquo; the Aide agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nor at any moment on Alta Avenue;&rdquo; he put
his hand on the other&rsquo;s arm&mdash;&ldquo;you know, Bernheim,
it&rsquo;s not you I object to, it&rsquo;s the idea. I
always like you with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Colonel&rsquo;s face flushed, and for an instant
he did not reply; when he did, his voice was low
and faintly husky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Sire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke glanced at him in quick surprise,
and understood; sometimes Bernheim&rsquo;s intense devotion
overflowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace up, Colonel,&rdquo; he exclaimed, with sudden
gayety, &ldquo;brace up! you won&rsquo;t have to milk that
cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then both men laughed, and the normal situation
was resumed.</p>
<p>The bells began to chime midnight, as they
reached the Embassy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait for me,&rdquo; Armand said; &ldquo;I may
be late. Go back and send an orderly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait, myself, sir, if
you will permit; they have a game here I rather
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care, Colonel; those boys will skin you
out of your very uniform&mdash;better look on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, sir, when I&rsquo;ve a poor draw;&rdquo; he answered
seriously, and wondered at the Archduke&rsquo;s
chuckling laugh.</p>
<p>Courtney greeted his friend with a nod and a
wave of his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you came in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
thinking about you&mdash;sit down.... Scotch?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, rye&mdash;and seltzer, please.&rdquo; He took the chair
across the desk from Courtney and waited until
the man had placed the decanters and glasses and
retired. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve been thinking about you,
too,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You got me into this infernal
mess, and now it&rsquo;s up to you to help me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney slowly lit a cigarette and scrutinized
the coal, critically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;that you have already
developed the ungratefulness of kings&mdash;I have high
hopes for your reign ... if you live to
reign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke put down his glass and regarded
him in exasperated surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, man, you too?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;If
I were given to nerves I would be seeing daggers
and bullets all around me&mdash;Bernheim croaks death;
and so does Moore; and now you join the chorus&mdash;pretty
soon the boys will be whistling it on the
Avenue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney picked up an Embassy official envelope
that lay before him, and tossed it across to the
Archduke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done a little work on my own account,
lately,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and here is what I got this
evening. I have always found this&mdash;agent,
reliable.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>It was only a few words, scratched hastily in
pencil on a sheet torn from a small note-book:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Danger very imminent&mdash;under no circumstance
go out at night without an escort.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Nice sort of country this, you brought me to,&rdquo;
said Armand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the country, my dear boy,&rdquo; Courtney
observed; &ldquo;it is beyond reproach. The trouble
is that one of your own family still is a barbarian;
and you insist upon treating him as though he were
civilized. For my part, I have no patience with
your altruism; you&rsquo;ve had quite sufficient warning&mdash;he
tried twice to kill you at the Vierle Masque;
and he has told you to your face that you would
never be king. Yet you persist in regarding him
as fighting square and in the open. Bernheim and
Moore are wise&mdash;they know your dear cousin&mdash;and
you,&mdash;well, you&rsquo;re a fool if you don&rsquo;t know
him, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a very long speech for Courtney, and
Armand had listened in surprise&mdash;it was most unusual
for his imperturbable friend to grow emphatic,
either in voice or gesture, and it impressed
him as Bernheim and Moore never had. In truth,
he had no particular scruples against meeting
Lotzen in the good, old-fashioned, cloak-and-dagger
way; but what irked him was the necessity of being
always on the <i>qui vive</i> to resist assault or to avoid
a trap; and the seeming absurdity of it in Dornlitz
of the twentieth century. It made him feel
such a simpleton, to be looking for bravos in dark
alleys, or to wear steel vests, or to be eternally
watchful and suspicious of every one and everything.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want me to do,&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;go
down to Lotzen&rsquo;s palace and stick my sword through
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you may not&mdash;it&rsquo;s what he would
do to you, if he could&mdash;but that&rsquo;s not our way;
we&rsquo;re civilized ... to a certain point.
But what you may do is to take every precaution
against him; and then, if you get the chance in fair
justification, kill him as unconcernedly as he would
kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke sat silent, his cigar between his
teeth, the smoke floating in a thin strand across
his face, his eyes upon the desk before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, my boy,&rdquo; Courtney went on, after
a pause, &ldquo;I assume you are in the game to the
end, and in to win. If you&rsquo;re not, the whole matter
is easy of adjustment&mdash;renounce the Crown and
marry the Princess ... and live somewhere
beyond the borders of Valeria&mdash;come back to
America, indeed; I&rsquo;ll see that you have again your
commission in the Engineer&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand&rsquo;s lips closed a bit tighter on his cigar,
his fingers began to play upon the chair-arm, and
his glance shifted for an instant to the other&rsquo;s face,
then back to the desk. And Courtney read his
mind and pressed on to clinch the purpose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re in to win&mdash;and it&rsquo;s your duty
to your friends to win; it&rsquo;s your duty to your
friends to win, I repeat&mdash;your first obligation is
to keep alive; a dead archduke is of no earthly use
in the king business we have in hand. You may
go straight to Glory, but that won&rsquo;t help out the
poor devils you leave here in Lotzen&rsquo;s clutches,
and who have been true to you, never doubting that
you would be true to them. Your life belongs to
them, now; and you have no right to fritter it
away in silly, stubborn recklessness....
There, I&rsquo;ve spoken my mind, and quite too frankly,
may be; but I&rsquo;ll promise never to bother you again.
After all, it&rsquo;s for you to decide&mdash;not for a meddling
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke smiled. &ldquo;And just to prove that
the friend isn&rsquo;t meddling, I shall accept his advice&mdash;bearing
in mind, however, that this is particularly
an exigency where prudence must be subordinate
to daring. Prudence is all very well in the abstract,
but it is more dangerous to our success than recklessness.
I&rsquo;m playing for a Crown and a Nation&rsquo;s favor&mdash;let
my personal courage be questioned for an
instant, and the game is lost as surely as though
I were dead. As for my dear cousin of Lotzen, I
assure you I&rsquo;ve not the least scruple about killing
him, under proper opportunity. In fact, I&rsquo;m inclined
to think I should rather enjoy it. I admit
now that there have been times when I regret I
didn&rsquo;t run him through at the Vierle Masque.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>Courtney nodded. &ldquo;It would have saved you
all this trouble&mdash;I wanted to call to you to make an
end of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do murder; I had disarmed him. Next
time, I&rsquo;ll make a different play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be a next time, if the Duke has
the choosing. He isn&rsquo;t the sort to seek death, and
he knows you are his master. You&rsquo;ll have to kill
him in a mel&eacute;e, or man&oelig;uvre him into a position
where he has no option but to fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is man&oelig;uvring himself into a position where
he will have to contend with a far more formidable
blade than mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney&rsquo;s eye-brows lifted expressively. Than
the Archduke himself there was but one better
swordsman in the kingdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has Lotzen been doing to Moore?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Insulting Elise d&rsquo;Essold&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By making advances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand nodded. &ldquo;And in a particularly nasty
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t bothered about Moore,&rdquo; said Courtney.
&ldquo;He thinks he is safe from any one that
isn&rsquo;t of his station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know the Irishman&mdash;Moore would
kill him without a thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; said Courtney. &ldquo;Moore is
bred to respect for royalty; he would hesitate to
use sword against one of the Blood except in
defense.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lotzen would best not bank much on that for
immunity if he pursue d&rsquo;Essold&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so much the better; between you, the
trick should be turned; though, as a matter of
abstract justice, it&rsquo;s your particular work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I shan&rsquo;t shirk it,&rdquo; said Armand&mdash;then
he laughed&mdash;&ldquo;on the whole, I&rsquo;m something of a
savage myself; Lotzen hasn&rsquo;t got all of it for the
family, it would seem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;We all are
savages at the core&mdash;it&rsquo;s only a question of the
veneer&rsquo;s thickness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of its thinness, I should say. However, now
that you have saved my precious life, and dedicated
me to care and prudence and to killing my enemies,
we can get down to business. You had something
to tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you,&rdquo; said Courtney. &ldquo;I wanted
to show you that note and save your precious life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke picked up the paper, and read it
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be the party who wrote this,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;can help you answer the question I came to ask:
what brought Lotzen to the Summer Palace, this
afternoon; and, in particular, why did he go into
the King&rsquo;s library?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney lit a fresh cigarette and watched the
match burn to a cinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t your second question the answer to the
first?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless; but what&rsquo;s the answer to the
second?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney shook his head. &ldquo;I pass&mdash;unless you
can give me some details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s everything I know,&rdquo; said Armand.
&ldquo;Moore, as Adjutant to the Regent, occupies part
of the King&rsquo;s suite as his quarters. This afternoon,
he went out, leaving open the corridor door
of the library. A little later Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Essold&eacute;
saw Lotzen come from the library&mdash;subsequently
he met Moore and casually remarked to him
that, as he passed his quarters, the door being open,
he had taken the liberty of looking at His late
Majesty&rsquo;s portrait, which he wished to have
copied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney considered a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really most interesting to study your
cousin&rsquo;s methods,&rdquo; he said presently. &ldquo;He seems
to take particular pleasure in telling one what he
knows will not be believed. It was quite absurd to
offer such a fool explanation, if he really wished
to explain&mdash;and none knows it better than Lotzen.
It was just as though he had said to Moore: &lsquo;Tell
the Archduke Armand, I&rsquo;ve been in the library,
I&rsquo;ve accomplished what I went for, and he may go
to the devil, with my compliments.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very well, as an exposition of Lotzen&rsquo;s
methods,&rdquo; said Armand; &ldquo;but what concerns me is
his motive; what was it he went for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Book of Laws, possibly,&rdquo; Courtney replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense&mdash;he knows it&rsquo;s not in the library&mdash;if
it were, I would have had it days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how does he know you haven&rsquo;t got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How! Because I&rsquo;d have produced it to prove
my title.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney smiled. &ldquo;Certainly you would&mdash;if it
proved your title; but if it didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You overlook Frederick&rsquo;s decree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t&mdash;you overlook the fact that no one
has ever seen that decree, and that Lotzen is entitled
to assume it was not executed&mdash;that the whole
story is fabricated, and that you have made away
with the Book in order to throw the election into
the House of Nobles; and so to have a chance for
the Crown, when, in reality, you are entitled to
none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lotzen understands perfectly that Dehra told
the truth,&rdquo; said Armand; &ldquo;and that I&rsquo;ve not got
the Book&mdash;for my part, I&rsquo;m almost ready to accept
her notion that he has it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney leaned back in his chair, and studied
the smoke rings he sent whirling upwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t agree with you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;indeed,
since his visit to the library, I&rsquo;m more convinced
than ever that he hasn&rsquo;t the Book. He pretends
to have it, so as to mislead you in your search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely, in your view of him,&rdquo; said
Armand, &ldquo;it is to decoy me into a trap where he
can make an end of me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;ve guessed it,&rdquo; said Courtney,
after a moment&rsquo;s thought; &ldquo;and what is more,
it&rsquo;s the key to Lotzen&rsquo;s plan of campaign, and it
proves conclusively his murderous purpose. I&rsquo;d
be very shy of information that points Book-ward,
unless you know the informant; above everything,
don&rsquo;t be fooled by the device of a rendezvous, or
a tattling servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough; and yet I must not let slip any
chance that might lead to the recovery of the Book;
my equivocal position demands that it be found,
both to vindicate Dehra&rsquo;s story and to justify my
own claim to the Succession. Indeed, to my mind,
I have no chance whatever unless Frederick&rsquo;s decree
is produced. However, Lotzen won&rsquo;t use such
hoary artifices; he will have some simple little plot
that will enmesh me by its very innocence. As a
schemer against him I&rsquo;m not even an &lsquo;also ran.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, therefore, my dear Armand,&rdquo; said Courtney
quickly, &ldquo;you must be prepared to cut the
meshes when they close; an escort&mdash;a sword&mdash;a
pistol&mdash;a steel vest&mdash;there&rsquo;s where you get your
chance at him. Between the schemer and the ready
fighter, I&rsquo;ll gamble on the fighter every time....
It&rsquo;s a pity you&rsquo;ve lost Moore&mdash;you
and he would make a famous pair. Bernheim is a
good sort, but Moore is worth twenty of him in
this business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>The Archduke&rsquo;s eyes brightened&mdash;the Irishman
and he together could make a merry fight&mdash;an altogether
worth-while sort of fight&mdash;a fight that
the Great Henry himself, in his younger days,
would have sought with eager blade and joyful
heart&mdash;a quick, sharp fight that gave the enemy
no rest nor quarter&mdash;a thrust&mdash;a fall&mdash;a careless
laugh&mdash;a dripping point wiped on a handkerchief.
He saw it all, and his fingers tingled and his eyes
went brighter still.</p>
<p>And across the table Courtney blew ring upon
ring of smoke, and watched him curiously, until
the intent look waned and passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;did you kill him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I killed him ... and even wiped
my sword&mdash;much ground have I to cast reproach at
Lotzen.&rdquo; He got up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going; if I sit under
your tutelage any longer, I&rsquo;ll be jabbling holes in
the good citizens I meet on the Avenue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With that stick?&rdquo; Courtney asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot&mdash;the good citizen is safe to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not. Let me give you a sword or
a revolver.&rdquo; And when both were declined, he
held up the paper: &ldquo;Danger imminent,&rdquo; he
warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bernheim will take care of me,&rdquo; said Armand;
&ldquo;and a light stick isn&rsquo;t a bad sort of rapier, if it
is handled properly. I&rsquo;m glad for this talk, and
to have learned how very thin my veneer is.&mdash;I&rsquo;m
going back to the Epsau now, and teach Bernheim
the scalp dance. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And trade him to the Regent for Moore, the
first thing in the morning,&rdquo; Courtney urged.</p>
<p>The Archduke paused at the threshold:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, may be I shall,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I believe he
is a bit more the savage.&rdquo; He faced about. &ldquo;As
for you, my dear Dick, you&rsquo;re cut out for a typical
missionary&mdash;you would have the natives killing one
another within an hour after you landed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danger imminent!&rdquo; called Courtney, and the
door swung shut.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<h2 id="c11">XI
<br /><span class="small">FIRST BLOOD</span></h2>
<p>The Archduke knew where to find his Aide, so
he waved aside the servant and went on to the billiard
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me, boys,&rdquo; he said, as they sprang
up; &ldquo;go on with the deal&mdash;unless,&rdquo; motioning
toward Bernheim&rsquo;s big pile of chips, &ldquo;you want to
be relieved of the beginner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness is ready to go?&rdquo; Bernheim
asked.</p>
<p>Armand nodded. &ldquo;But that mustn&rsquo;t take you
away; luck&rsquo;s with you, it&rsquo;s a crime to desert her&mdash;I
know the way home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Colonel pushed his winnings into the centre
of the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to thank you for a delightful evening,
messieurs,&rdquo; he said, with his stiff, military bow;
&ldquo;and since I must leave before the end of the game,
I make a John-pot of these for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke took him by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may not do that, Colonel,&rdquo; he laughed;
&ldquo;they cannot let you. You must cash in, and give
them a chance some other time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is my pleasure, sir, for them to have
back what I won.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And it will be their pleasure to take it back,&rdquo;
said Armand kindly, &ldquo;but not in that way&mdash;they
must win it back from <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernheim drew himself up. &ldquo;I understand, sir,&rdquo;
he said.&mdash;&ldquo;Messieurs, I salute you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they came out on the Avenue, a fine rain
was blowing in clouds, but the Archduke declined
the servant&rsquo;s offer to ring the stables for a carriage.
The street was deserted; not a pedestrian, nor even
a cab, was in sight, either way. Both men wrapped
their capes around them, and strode off toward the
Epsau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dirty night, sir,&rdquo; the Colonel observed&mdash;&ldquo;it
might have been well to take the carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; said Armand; &ldquo;to walk in the rain
or to ride in the snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The snow, yes&mdash;but we don&rsquo;t have much of it
in Dornlitz&mdash;one must go to the mountains in the
North&mdash;to Lotzenia&mdash;for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear cousin&rsquo;s country!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His titular estates&mdash;but not his country,&rdquo; said
Bernheim. &ldquo;He has the old castle on the Dreer
and a huge domain&mdash;that King Frederick&rsquo;s father
gave to Lotzen&rsquo;s father in a foolish moment of generosity&mdash;but
he hasn&rsquo;t the heart of a single inhabitant;
indeed, until his banishment there, I think
he had never even seen the place. But with the old
castle of Dalberg, across the valley&mdash;the cradle of
your race, sir&mdash;it&rsquo;s very different. Who rules
there is the idol of the Lotzenians; he is their
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
hereditary lord; and they can never forget that he
belonged to them before he took the Crown, and
that they helped him in the taking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now that there is no king, whom will they
serve until the new lord comes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernheim raised his cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her Royal Highness the Regent&mdash;until they
serve you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No man could be quite insensible to all that this
implied of kingly power, and the traditional
homage of inherited devotion, the hot love for him
who was born their chief&mdash;given them of God, and
their own before all others. The Archduke&rsquo;s fingers
closed a bit tighter on his stick, his blood
pulsed faster, and the stubborn spirit of old
Hugo awoke to new life; and in that moment, in
the dead of night, with the rain whipping around
them, as it wrapped the city in a cloud of glowing
mist, he turned his face forever from his old life,
its memories and methods, and passed finally into
the New, its high destiny, its privileges, its responsibilities,
its dangers and its cares. He would make
this fight in the Duke&rsquo;s own fashion, and end it in
the Duke&rsquo;s own way; if he fell in the ending, he
would see to it that the Duke fell first; not that he
cared for his company in the out-going&mdash;though,
doubtless, it would matter little then&mdash;but because
it were not well to leave him behind to plague the
kingdom with his viciousness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>They now had left the more modern portion of
the Avenue and were in the older section, where
the houses were smaller and stood only a little way
from the sidewalk; though occasionally a more pretentious
one was set far back, with trees and shrubbery
around it, and a wall before, hiding it almost
entirely from the street.</p>
<p>In front of one of these residences, the Archduke
suddenly stopped and caught Bernheim&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I heard a cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernheim, too, had heard it, but he was not
minded to let his master know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the wind, doubtless, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t the wind&mdash;it was a voice, and
a woman&rsquo;s voice, I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A blast of rain and mist swept by them and
through the trees, stirring the leaves into a rustling
as of the sighs of disembodied spirits, while
the swaying street lights flung the shadows hither
and thither like pursuing cerecloths struggling to
re-shroud them in their forsaken garb.</p>
<p>Bernheim looked around to fix the location.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the De Saure house,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and has
been unoccupied for months&mdash;Your Highness must
have been mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke moved on. &ldquo;Doubtless, the wind
plays queer tricks with sound on such a night; yet
my ears rarely deceive me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>They were passing the wide entrance gates, and
he went nearer and peered within&mdash;and as though
in answer, from out the darkness came the shriek
of one in awful terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t strike me again! For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t
strike me!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke seized the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Bernheim,&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;it <i>is</i> a
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Aide caught his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, sir,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&mdash;it is nothing for
you to mix in&mdash;it is for the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand made no answer; he was trying to find
the latch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray Your Highness to refrain,&rdquo; Bernheim
begged; &ldquo;an Archduke&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Help! For God&rsquo;s sake help!</i>&rdquo; came the cry.</p>
<p>The latch yielded, and Armand flung back the
gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a man, and
yonder a woman calls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang down the path toward the house,
which he could see now in black forbiddingness
among the trees far back from the street.</p>
<p>Again Bernheim ventured to protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be Lotzen&rsquo;s trap, sir,&rdquo; he warned.</p>
<p>For the shadow of an instant the Archduke hesitated;
and at that moment the voice rang out
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t strike me! Don&rsquo;t str</i>&mdash;&rdquo; and a gurgling
choke ended it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To the devil with Lotzen!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and
dashed on.</p>
<p>And Bernheim, with a silent curse, went beside
him, loosening his sword as he ran, and feeling
for the small revolver he had slipped inside his
tunic, before they left the Epsau. To him, now,
everything of mystery or danger spelled Lotzen&mdash;but
even if it were not he, there was trouble
enough ahead, and scandal enough, too, likely;
scandal in which the Governor of Dornlitz, an Archduke,
may be the King, had no place, and which
could serve only to injure him before the people
and in the esteem of the Nobles. Better that half
the women in Dornlitz should be beaten and choked
than that his master should be smirched by the
tongue of calumny. He had no patience with this
Quixotism that succored foolish females at foolish
hours, in a place where neither the female nor they
had any right to enter&mdash;and where, for her, at
least, to enter was a crime. If he were able, he
would have picked the Archduke up bodily, and
borne him back to the palace, and have left the
infernal woman to shift for herself, and to save
herself or not, as her luck might rule.</p>
<p>Then they brought up suddenly in front of the
house; and as they paused to find the steps, a light
flashed, for an instant, from the upper windows,
and disappeared&mdash;as if an electric switch had been
turned on, and off again. But its life had been
long enough to show the broad entrance porch, and
the big doors beyond it&mdash;and that they were open
wide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>At the sight, Bernheim swore a good round oath
and seized the Archduke&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trap, my lord, it&rsquo;s a trap!&rdquo; he
exclaimed.</p>
<p>And again Armand hesitated; and again the cry
came, though muffled now and indistinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have to chance it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
desert a woman who calls for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; said Bernheim, knowing that
further opposition was useless, &ldquo;but if it is a
trap, she&rsquo;ll be the first I kill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went softly up the steps and into the
vestibule; not a sound came from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you familiar with this house?&rdquo; the Archduke
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very, sir; I&rsquo;ve been in it scores of times&mdash;salon
on right, dining room and library opposite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the stairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the rear, on the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you find the electric switch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Colonel drew his revolver and stepped quickly
inside; he knew there was a row of buttons near
the library door, and he found them readily. With
a single motion he pushed them in, and every
chandelier and side-light in the entire lower floor
sprang to life&mdash;illuminating rooms, solitary and
undisturbed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>Over the mantel in the library hung a pair of
beautiful old duelling rapiers, and the Archduke
snatched one down and tried its balance; then took
the other and handed it to Bernheim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it, man,&rdquo; he said, as the Colonel touched
his own sword; &ldquo;take it, it&rsquo;s worth an armory of
those; its reach alone may save your life, if we
are crowded.&rdquo; He made a pass in the air and
laughed&mdash;it was sweet any time to feel the hilt of
such a weapon, but now it was doubly sweet, with
danger ahead and the odds he knew not what. He
pointed upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;now for the next floor
and the clash of steel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Bernheim shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray you, my lord, be prudent,&rdquo; he urged&mdash;&ldquo;remember,
to us you are the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faintly, from somewhere above, the cry came&mdash;weak
and suppressed, but audible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Help! oh help!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn the woman!&rdquo; Bernheim exclaimed, dashing
forward to go first; and failing, by four steps.</p>
<p>The upper hall was dark, save for the reflection
from below, but Armand caught the sheen of a
switch plate and pressed the key. Five closed doors
confronted him&mdash;without hesitation he chose the
rear one on the right, and sprang toward it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>As he did so, the lights on the first floor went
out, the front doors closed with a bang, and a key
turned in the lock and was withdrawn. Instinctively
he stopped and drew back; at the same moment,
Bernheim reached over and turned off their
lights also, leaving the house in impenetrable
darkness.</p>
<p>The Archduke stepped quickly across toward
Bernheim, and bumped into him mid-way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trap,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;the locking of
the door proves it&mdash;these rooms are empty, but
we&rsquo;ll have a look and not be caught between two
fires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn the woman!&rdquo; said Bernheim.</p>
<p>Armand laughed softly. &ldquo;Never mind her, we
have other work on hand now. You keep the stairway;
put your sword into any one who tries to come
up; I&rsquo;ll go through the rooms,&rdquo; and he was gone
before the Colonel could protest.</p>
<p>Bernheim tip-toed over to the head of the stairs
and, leaning on the rail, listened. He could detect
no sound in the hall below; the silence was as utter
as the blackness. He stooped and felt the carpet
on the stairs; it was soft and very thick, the sort
that deadens noise. Behind him, a door closed
softly, and he saw the gleam of a faint light along
a sill, and, in a moment, along another further
toward the front. Evidently, the Archduke had
met no misadventure yet. And so he stood there,
tense and expectant, while the darkness pressed
hard upon his eyes, and set them burning with the
strain of striving to pierce through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Presently he felt that some one was coming
toward him, and then the faintest whisper spoke
his name. He reached out, and his fingers touched
the Archduke&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Armand put his mouth close to his Aide&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rooms deserted,&rdquo; he whispered&mdash;&ldquo;what&rsquo;s on
the third floor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mere garret; the servants quarters are
in a detached building in the rear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll chance the garret&mdash;I laid a chair across
the foot of those stairs&mdash;and also at the head of
the back stairs&mdash;anything doing below?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet as the grave, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An apt simile, Bernheim,&rdquo; said the Archduke;
&ldquo;there is going to be a death or two down there
to-night, if we can manage it&mdash;just as a gentle
notice to our cousin of what he may expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old soldier&rsquo;s hand sought impulsively his
master&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it, my lord?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do; I&rsquo;m&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; a stair creaked very faintly&mdash;&ldquo;they&rsquo;re
coming,&rdquo; he ended.</p>
<p>Both men bent forward listening ...
the seconds passed ... no sound came to
them. Then Bernheim bethought himself of the
rail, and laid his ear upon it. Instantly he was up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are coming,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I could hear
them distinctly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Armand. &ldquo;We will give them the
steel as soon as they&rsquo;re within reach&mdash;be ready&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
take the right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>The stairway was of more than medium width,
and straight-away almost to the lower floor, the
turn being at the bottom. While the lights were
on, Bernheim had noticed a heavy oak chest against
the wall near where they were standing. Now
it suddenly occurred to him how it could be used.
Asking the Archduke to bear aside a moment, he
seized it in his powerful arms, and carrying it to
the head of the stairs hurled it, with all his strength,
down into the darkness.</p>
<p>There was a heavy thud as of human bodies
struck, wild shrieks of pain and terror, and then a
deafening crash, as the chest broke asunder against
the wall below, followed directly by moans, and
curses, and struggles to get free.</p>
<p>Although Armand had not seen what his Aide
had done, he could picture it all now, and he
laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear away the d&eacute;bris, gentlemen!&rdquo; he called.
&ldquo;On to the charge! Don&rsquo;t be a lot of quitters;
we&rsquo;ve plenty of ammunition left; <i>en avant!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>But only the moans answered him. He drew
Bernheim closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suggest,&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;shall we
go down?&rdquo;&mdash;And the upsetting of the chair at
the rear stairs answered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn on the lights when I whistle,&rdquo; he ordered,
and stole swiftly to the rear of the hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>Doubtless the purpose had been to attack them
simultaneously in front and rear, and here was the
chance to give this detachment, also, a surprise.
He heard the chair being set carefully aside,
followed by foot-falls such as are made only by
shoeless feet. The darkness was impenetrable, but
he knew they paused at the door, and then came
slowly forward, passing him so closely he could
have touched them with his hand. The next instant
he gave the signal.</p>
<p>As the lights blazed out, disclosing three masked
men with drawn swords, the Archduke leaped forward
and, with the hilt of his rapier, struck the
one nearest him behind the ear. The rogue dropped
in his tracks. At the same moment, Bernheim&rsquo;s
pistol cracked, and another went down, shot
through the head. The third stood irresolute; and
him the Archduke addressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the pistol, yonder, or the sword, here,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;which will you choose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fellow chanced to be almost in line with the
front stairs, and for answer he sprang across the
hall and dashed down them. Bernheim&rsquo;s gun spoke
thrice: the first bullet struck the wall; the
second, the newel post; the third, fired into the semi-obscurity
below, and as the knave&rsquo;s head was almost
on a line with the floor, brought an answering cry;
but it did not disable him; they heard him stumble
over the broken chest, then the key was thrust into
the lock, the front door was flung back, and he
crossed the porch at a run.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the last of them, I fancy,&rdquo; said Armand.</p>
<p>Bernheim looked at the pistol in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did have any patience with these toys,&rdquo;
he growled; &ldquo;three shots across a blanket, and only
a touch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke pointed to the dead body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did pretty well there,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luck, pure luck.&rdquo; He went over to the stairs.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear anything,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the chest
seems to be very quiet&mdash;what about the lights; shall
I turn them off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First take a look at these gentlemen,&rdquo; said
Armand; &ldquo;do you know them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Aide stooped over the one he had killed and
jerked off the mask that covered his upper face&mdash;then
did the same with the other, and shook his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw either of them,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
they look the part&mdash;you hit this one exactly on
the spot; he is paralyzed or dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will leave him to find out for himself which
it is,&rdquo; the Archduke answered&mdash;&ldquo;unless, Colonel,
you wish to search further for the lady&mdash;as I remember,
you promised her the first killing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernheim laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather imagine your lady is a man&mdash;I think
we shall find her at the foot of the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran quickly down, vaulted over the d&eacute;bris
with the aid of the rail, and turned on the light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>The Archduke had followed him as far as the
turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as though you got her, Colonel,&rdquo; he
remarked, pointing with his rapier to two men who
lay among the fragments of the chest. One was
dead&mdash;face and head mashed flat, the crimson
splotch on the white wall marking where the heavy
missile had crushed them. The other, both legs
broken at the ankles, and half his ribs driven in,
was pinned in the corner, unconscious&mdash;a singularly
repulsive creature, with huge, protruding teeth,
pimply face, an enormous red nose, and a mouth
like a fish&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Bernheim looked him over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positively, I&rsquo;d be ashamed to employ such
carrion,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand
Lotzen; he is an aesthete, even in his crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke stepped carefully into the hall,
and laid his rapier on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us be off,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there is nothing more
to do.&rdquo; He turned toward the door&mdash;then stopped
and reached for the sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Others are coming,&rdquo; he said;&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll fight it
out right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the quick tramp of feet on the porch,
and a sergeant and two police entered. Their
looks of bewildered surprise, as they recognized
the Archduke and his Aide, were so comical that
even Bernheim smiled, though his words were curt
enough.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Salute, men!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know His
Royal Highness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sergeant&rsquo;s hand went up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pardon, sir,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;but we
heard shots&mdash;and this house is supposed to be unoccupied.
I am sorry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand motioned him to silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to pardon, sergeant,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;you are doing your duty very properly,
and you come in good time. You will search this
place thoroughly, including the grounds; remove
the dead and wounded immediately; see that all
knowledge of the affair is suppressed, and report
to me at noon to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer saluted again. &ldquo;Yes, Your Highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are our capes, Colonel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the library&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get them.&rdquo;...
He dropped the Archduke&rsquo;s about his shoulders,
and the sergeant did the same for him.</p>
<p>As they gained the Avenue, the cathedral bell
struck three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice hour for an old man like you, Bernheim,
to be going home,&rdquo; said the Archduke.</p>
<p>A quizzical smile came into the Aide&rsquo;s stern
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady called me,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<h2 id="c12">XII
<br /><span class="small">THE SOLE SURVIVOR</span></h2>
<p>Ferida Palace, the residence of His Royal
Highness the Duke of Lotzen, on the Alta Avenue
half a mile or so beyond the Epsau, is a great,
rambling pile of gray stone, of varying height and
diverse architecture, set in the midst of grounds
that occupy two entire squares, and are surrounded
by a high, embattled wall, pierced with four wide
entrances, whose bronze gates are famous in their
craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Here the Duke lived in a splendor and munificence
almost rivaling the King himself, and with
a callous indifference to certain laws of society,
that would have scandalized the Capital had it become
public knowledge. But in his household, the
servant who babbled, never babbled twice; he left
Dornlitz quite too suddenly; and those who were
wise learned quickly that they lost nothing in wage
nor perquisite by being blind and dumb. For
Lotzen did not skimp his steward&mdash;all he required
was skillful service, and that what occurred within
the Palace must not go beyond the walls. Nevertheless,
in conduct, he was not the habitual libertine
and rou&eacute;,&mdash;the contrary was, in truth, the fact&mdash;but
he proposed to have the opportunity to do as
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
he liked when the fancy moved him&mdash;and to have
no carping moralist praying over him and then
retailing his misdeeds with unctuous smirks of pious
horror. Not that he cared a centime for their horrors
or their prayers, but because it were not well
to irritate unduly the King, by doings which he
might not countenance, if brought formally to his
attention&mdash;though the Duke was well aware that
Frederick troubled himself not at all how he went
to the devil, nor when, save that the quicker he
went the better.</p>
<p>And so it was, that he had not hesitated to bring
with him the woman of raven hair and dead-white
cheek, and to install her in the gorgeous suite in
the west wing of the Ferida, where others, as frail
but far less fair, had been before her&mdash;and the
world never the wiser&mdash;just as now it was not the
wiser as to Madeline Spencer&rsquo;s presence. The time
was not yet for her to show herself, and in the
meantime she had remained secluded; she was too
well known in Dornlitz to escape recognition; and
even Lotzen dared not, at this exigency, so spurn
public sentiment as to sponsor the adventuress
whom he had procured to pose as wife to the Archduke
Armand.</p>
<p>She had come with him to the Capital with deep
misgiving, and only after much urging and jeweled
caresses; though not the least of the inducements
was the hope of annoying the Princess Dehra&mdash;for
whom she had conceived the most violent hate. By
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
herself it would, of course, have been a fatulously
foolish hate, but with Lotzen, and under the peculiar
situation existing at Court, there was a
chance&mdash;and it was this chance she meant to play
for and to seize. And besides, it promised the excitement
and ample financial returns that were the
mainsprings of her existence.</p>
<p>And though it fretted her beyond measure to
dawdle in idleness and tiresome inanition, even in
the luxury of the Ferida, yet she endured it with
amazing equanimity; and amused herself, the while,
by flirting with the Duke&rsquo;s friends, when the Duke
was not in presence&mdash;and sometimes when he was.
And then, when he sulked or stormed, a soft arm
would slip around his neck, and a pair of red lips
smile close to his face; and, presently, he was caressing
the one, and pleading for the others&mdash;and there
was peace, and on her terms. The marvel of it all,
was how she held him&mdash;as no woman had ever held
him hitherto; she made no pretense of love, nor
tried for it from him&mdash;a pleasant camaraderie was
all she gave, and all she asked for; favor-free to-day,
favor-cold to-morrow; elusive as a moon-beam;
fickle as the wind; tempting and alluring as a vestal;
false and faithless as the Daughter of the
Foam.</p>
<p>And though Lotzen knew it&mdash;and knew it well&mdash;for
she had told him frankly what she was and
what she lived for, yet her fascinations negatived
her words; while her indifference as to whether she
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
stayed or went&mdash;and which he was thoroughly aware
was not assumed&mdash;only captivated him the more,
who had been used to easy conquest and clinging
hearts.</p>
<p>He had explained fully to her the complication
produced by the disappearance of the Laws, recounting
in detail the scene at the Royal Council,
when the compromise was forced; but as to Adolph
and the incidents of the King&rsquo;s library he said
never a word. To her prompt query, as to how he
accounted for the Book&rsquo;s disappearance, he answered
that the American, knowing it contained no
decree in his favor, had stolen and, doubtless, destroyed
it&mdash;and that the Princess Royal&rsquo;s story was
a clever lie&mdash;&ldquo;just such a lie as you, yourself,
would have told for me, in a similar exigency,&rdquo; he
had added; and she had smiled an acquiescence&mdash;thinking,
the while, that for the American she
would have done much more than lie, and gladly, if
he would but let her.</p>
<p>Since the day when, as Colonel Spencer&rsquo;s bride,
she had come to the old fort on the Missouri, and
had first set eyes on Captain Armand Dalberg,
there was but one man who might have stirred her
cold heart to an honest beat; and though he had
ignored her overtures, and finally had scorned them
with scarring words, yet it had not entirely killed
the old desire; and even now, after all that she had
done against him, and was ready yet to do, a single
word from him would have brought her to his
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
side. Yet, because she knew that word would never
come, and that another woman claimed him honestly
and without fear, she would go on with her part;
and all the more willingly that it enabled her to
strike through him the woman who had won him.</p>
<p>And now, after the two weeks quiescence, the
restless fever was upon her, and the Duke had
caught the signs; next would come the call to
Paris; and he knew the second call would win. If
he were to hold her, it was time to start the campaign
she had come to assist&mdash;and that very day
was his visit to the Summer Palace, and the sudden
determination of his plan. But when, in the evening,
he had gone to her apartments to tell her of
it, and to discuss the opening moves, she had sent
him the message that she was indisposed and had
retired, and that he should breakfast with her the
next day.</p>
<p>And in the morning he had found her in her
boudoir, in the most enticing of soft blue gowns,
and no touch of dishabille nor carelessness in all
her attire, from the arrangement of the raven hair
to the shoeing of the slender feet. Madeline Spencer
was much too clever to let a man see her in
neglig&eacute;e when, to him, the hour for neglig&eacute;e was
passed.</p>
<p>She met him with a smile, and let him kiss her
cheek.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry about last night, dear,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but I was quite too wretched to see even you&mdash;and
I wanted to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat on the arm of the chair, playing softly
with her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could believe that it was just I you
wanted,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She shot him an upward glance of her siren eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking about this business that
we have on hand,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;and, Ferdinand,
if you wish my aid, you must get busy&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t endure this stagnation longer. I&rsquo;m a wild
beast that would die in confinement; I need the
jungle and the air and sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed, and pinched her ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your jungle, little one, is the Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es
and <i>cher Maxim&rsquo;s</i>; <i>la chaleur communicative du
banquet</i>;&mdash;your air and sky, the adulation of the
masculine and the stare of admiring eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is; and I&rsquo;ve been away a long, long
time; yet I want to stay with you until this work
is ended&mdash;because&rdquo; (taking his hand and smiling
up at him) &ldquo;you have been good to me, and because
it promises excitement of a novel sort&mdash;only,
dear, do let us be at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A door swung back. &ldquo;Madam is served!&rdquo; came
the monotone.</p>
<p>As they went in, the Duke slipped his arm around
her slender waist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be at it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;send the
servants away and I&rsquo;ll tell you my plan; it was for
that I came last evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, tell me!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as the door closed
behind the footman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going back to Lotzenia,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She paused, and the black eye-brows went up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo; she inflected.</p>
<p>He nodded. &ldquo;That is where the game will be
played out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not here, in Dornlitz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s easier there&mdash;and surer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made to shiver. &ldquo;So, for me, it&rsquo;s only out
of a charming mausoleum into a common grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed. &ldquo;It will be a rarely lively grave,
my dear Madeline, and, I promise you, exciting
enough for even your starved nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon, I trust&mdash;there is work to be done here
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I may help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you may help&mdash;the plan needs you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the plan?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very simplest I could devise,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;to
lure the American to Lotzenia and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled comprehendingly. &ldquo;Why take all
that trouble&mdash;why not kill him in Dornlitz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung up a cautioning hand. &ldquo;Softly, my
dear, softly&mdash;and not so blunt in the words&mdash;and
as I said, it&rsquo;s easier there and surer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it would be so much prettier to play the
game out here,&rdquo; she half objected; &ldquo;and more accordant
with your taste, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always more artistic
to run a man through with a rapier than to
kill him with a club; but in this business it&rsquo;s the
end alone that concerns me. Yet the primary essential,
in either method, is opportunity and
freedom of movement; neither is here; both will
be plentiful in the North.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, of course, at your friendly invitation, the
American will gladly accompany you to Lotzenia
and permit himself to be&mdash;offered up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An impatient smile shone in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand, Ferdinand, why you persist
in under-rating your enemy; it&rsquo;s the climax of
bad generalship. The American may be reckless
and a bit headstrong, but assuredly he is not a
fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;He can
fight, I grant you&mdash;but he can&rsquo;t scheme nor plot&mdash;nor
detect one, though it&rsquo;s as evident as the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; she waved her hand toward the
Epsau&mdash;&ldquo;it is he you&rsquo;re fighting for the Crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luck!&rdquo; he scoffed&mdash;&ldquo;a dotard King, a damn
Huzzar uniform, and a silly girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is his luck any the less now, with the girl
Regent of Valeria?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly not,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and hence another
reason for the mountains&mdash;she won&rsquo;t be with him
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave it up&mdash;she had tried repeatedly, but
it was impossible, it seemed, to arouse him to Armand&rsquo;s
real ability&mdash;when hate rides judgment,
reason lies bound and gagged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should the Governor of Dornlitz go to
far off Lotzenia?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He glanced around the room suspiciously; then
scribbled a line in pencil on his cuff and held it
over to her.</p>
<p>She read it, and looked at him in puzzled interrogation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you told me
that he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had anticipated her question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did,&rdquo; he interrupted quickly, &ldquo;but I have
no proof; and lately I have come to doubt it. At
any rate, this will disclose the truth. If my scheme
works, he will follow into Hell itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strikingly appropriate name for your Castle,
dear,&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>He nodded and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what if the scheme doesn&rsquo;t work?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that event, the laugh is on me, and we must
devise another means to draw him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which will be quite fruitless, I can assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will fight it out here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
I shall doubly need you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll get me, doubly welcome.&rdquo;...
She lit a cigarette and passed it to him; and lit
another for herself. &ldquo;Now, how are we to contrive
to set the trap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A footman entered and handed the Duke a visiting
card, with something penciled on it....</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bigler,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and he asks to be
admitted immediately&mdash;he&rsquo;s always in a rush. Tell
Count Bigler I&rsquo;ll see him presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stayed the servant with a motion; she did
not intend to lose Lotzen until he had told her the
whole plot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not have him here?&rdquo; she asked; &ldquo;and
then let him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means, if you will permit,&rdquo; and he
nodded to the footman.</p>
<p>Most women would have called Count Bigler
handsome; and not a few men, as well. He was
red-headed and ruddy, with clean-cut features,
square chin, and a laughing mouth, that contrary
to Valerian fashion was not topped by a moustache.
Since boyhood, he had been Lotzen&rsquo;s particular companion
and intimate; and, as is usual in such instances,
he was almost his antipode in temperament
and manner.</p>
<p>He saluted the Duke with easy off-handedness,
and bent with deferential courtesy over Mrs.
Spencer&rsquo;s hand; but pressing it altogether more
tightly than the attitude justified.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>She answered with the faintest finger tap and a
quick smile, and waved him to a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m <i>de trop</i>,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll vacate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame is never <i>de trop</i>, to me,&rdquo; he answered,
taking the cigarette she offered and smiling down
at her, through the smoke, as he lit it.</p>
<p>When he turned to sit down, the left side of his
face was, for the first time, toward the Duke, showing
the ear bound with strips of surgeon&rsquo;s plaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of Heaven, man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what
have you been doing with yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count laughed. &ldquo;Trading the top of my
ear for a day or two more of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duel?&rdquo; Lotzen asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, after a fashion, but not exactly under the
code.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The primeval woman stirred in Mrs. Spencer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story, Count, the story!&rdquo; she demanded,
coiling her lithe arms behind her head, and leaning
far back in languorous gracefulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the story that brings me here so early,&rdquo;
he replied.</p>
<p>The Duke was frowning. Duelling was a serious
crime in Valeria, even in the Army, and it was a
particularly unfortunate moment for Bigler to
offend; and especially as only the Governor of
Dornlitz or the Regent could save him from
punishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did you manage to get into such a mess
just at this time?&rdquo; he asked sharply. &ldquo;Was any
one killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count nodded. &ldquo;Four, I think; I didn&rsquo;t
stay to examine them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four! four! God, man, was it a massacre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost&mdash;I&rsquo;m the sole survivor on your side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lotzen&rsquo;s frown grew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On <i>my</i> side!&rdquo; he echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was assuming to act for you,&rdquo; Bigler
explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me!&mdash;who was on the other side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The American&mdash;the American and Bernheim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a space the Duke smoked in silence; then he
gave a faint chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They came rather close to making it five, didn&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo; He touched his ear&mdash;&ldquo;Bernheim, I suppose?...
Of course, the American would have
made it five. What a fool you are, Bigler, to go
into such a thing without telling me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you now,&rdquo; the Count grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m exceedingly grateful to my dear
cousin for leaving you to tell it. It&rsquo;s the only
service he has ever done me. I assume it isn&rsquo;t
necessary to ask if you got him&mdash;or even wounded
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite unnecessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madeline Spencer had been chafing at the delay;
now she arose, and, going over to a divan, sank
sinuously among the pillows, one trim, blue silk
ankle shimmering far below her skirts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you were as slow in the fight, Count, as you
are in getting at the story,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
a wonder to me how Bernheim missed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both men laughed, and Bigler&rsquo;s glance lingered
a moment in open admiration.</p>
<p>The Duke swung his hand toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame grows impatient,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Proceed,
Monsieur Edmund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count took a fresh cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was this way,&rdquo; he began, pivoting his chair
around on one back leg, so that he would have both
his auditors within his direct vision. &ldquo;The two
weeks we were bound to idleness mourning for old
Frederick, I spent in watching the American. I
soon discovered that it was his custom, every few
days, to visit, very late at night, his friend, the
American Ambassador, and that he invariably not
only walked the entire distance from the Epsau
and back, but also went unattended. It seemed to
me very simple to waylay him, some night on his
return; the streets were usually deserted then, and
he should be an easy victim, if set upon by enough
men to assure success. And I had about arranged
the matter, when I chanced to remember that the
De Saures were still in the country and their house
closed. It stands far back from the Avenue, you
know, and a safer and surer plan occurred to me:&mdash;I
would lure him into this house, and leave him
there for burial. In the dark, my four rogues
could put enough steel through him, from behind,
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
to insure his quick demise. I proposed to take no
chances with such a swordsman by giving him a
light; and besides, it was just as well that the men
should not know their victim. Nor did they ever
see me unmasked. For decoy, one of the rogues
procured a woman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the Duke,&mdash;&ldquo;one of their
women!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was voice, not beauty, I wanted&mdash;the cry of
a female for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lotzen nodded and smiled. &ldquo;Rather clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a week we met at the house at eleven
o&rsquo;clock every night, but the American didn&rsquo;t go
to the Embassy. Then, last night, at twelve, he
went, and old Bernheim with him. That didn&rsquo;t
bother me much, however, and we waited for their
return. They came about two, through driving
rain and wind; and the woman played her part perfectly.
Such piteous cries I never heard. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
strike me again&mdash;don&rsquo;t strike me again&mdash;help&mdash;help;&rsquo;
reiterated in tones that would have moved
even your heart, my dear Duke. I was concealed
near the gate and they moved me&mdash;and they caught
the American instantly, though Bernheim scented
danger and protested vigorously. &lsquo;It may be a
trap of Lotzen&rsquo;s,&rsquo; he warned. &lsquo;Damn Lotzen!&rsquo;
was the prompt answer, as the girl wailed again&mdash;I
tell you she was an artist at it; she, herself, must be
used to beatings. They ran up the path to the
house, I following; and here the whole scheme was
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
almost upset by some fool having left the front door
open. Bernheim protested that it proved the trap;
and even the American was hesitating, when again
the woman wailed. That settled it; and I dashed
around the house to the rear entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My purpose was to draw them upstairs and
finish the job there. They searched the first floor&mdash;we
were on the second&mdash;then, leaving all the electric
lights burning, they ascended&mdash;and we went down
the back way, turned off the lights and closed and
locked the doors. They promptly extinguished the
lights they had set going above, and the house was
in the densest darkness I have ever known. We
could hear them whispering in the upper hall; and
I sent two of my rogues up the front stairs and led
the others up the rear, intending to snap an electric
torch for the instant it would require to do
our work; and which seemed all the easier because
I had observed, at the gate, that the American was
without his sword. When we were half way up,
I heard a crash from the front, followed by the
American&rsquo;s laugh. I paused an instant, then hurried
on, and fell over a chair that had been placed
at the head of the stairs. Everything remained
quiet, however, and we went forward into the hall.
My finger was on the key of the torch when there
came a shrill whistle, and the lights went on. I
saw Bernheim in front of us, pistol in hand; it
flashed, and the man on my left went down. At
the same moment, the American sprang at us from
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
behind and felled the other fellow with the hilt of
a sword&mdash;where he got it the devil only knows. As
for me, I admit I was dazed with surprise; I heard
the American offer me the choice: pistol or sword&mdash;I
took the pistol. I had retained enough sense to
know I hadn&rsquo;t the faintest chance with him. The
front steps were near; I made the leap of my life,
and plunged down them. Bernheim fired three
times&mdash;this (indicating his ear) was the last; the
first two missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What had become of your other pair of
rogues?&rdquo; the Duke asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead. I fell over them at the foot of the
stairs, buried under a huge chest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flung upon them, doubtless, as they were ascending,&rdquo;
said Lotzen.</p>
<p>Bigler nodded. &ldquo;That was the crash I heard.&rdquo;
He took another cigarette, and lighted it carefully.
&ldquo;And that, madame, is the story,&rdquo; he ended,
looking at Mrs. Spencer.</p>
<p>She flashed him a bright smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nicest thing about it, my dear Count,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;is that you are here to tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if he doesn&rsquo;t in the least deserve to be
here,&rdquo; the Duke interjected. &ldquo;Such a&mdash;my dear
Edmund, don&rsquo;t do it again. You&rsquo;re too young
and innocent to die. Leave the strategy to me&mdash;and
my lady, yonder; we will give you enough of
fighting in due time&mdash;and soon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>The Count laughed in good natured imperturbability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done,&rdquo; he said frankly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to
take orders from you or my lady&mdash;particularly
from my lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke gave him a quick, sharp glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The orders will come through me,&rdquo; he said,
rather curtly.</p>
<p>Madeline Spencer held out her hand to the Count.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When His Highness grows jealous,&rdquo; she said,
languidly arising and shaking down her skirts,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s time, you know, for you to go&mdash;come back
when he is not here;&rdquo; and with a provoking smile
at the Duke, she flung the Count a kiss&mdash;&ldquo;for your
wounded ear, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<h2 id="c13">XIII
<br /><span class="small">IN THE JAPONICA WALK</span></h2>
<p>The Regent signed the last document, and, pushing
it across the table, laid aside the pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much better it would be if that were
&lsquo;Armand, Rex,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister was putting up his papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And better, still, if it were &lsquo;Dehra, Regina,&rsquo;&rdquo;
he returned, closing the portfolio and locking it.</p>
<p>She made a gesture of dissent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There would be no need for the Book, then,&rdquo;
he continued; &ldquo;and no danger of Lotzen becoming
king. It is God&rsquo;s blessing on Valeria that you were
you, and could assume the government&mdash;otherwise,
we would have had civil war. Your Highness has
no conception of the sentiment in the Army; it is
two to one for the Archduke; but Lotzen&rsquo;s third is
unduly powerful because of a coterie of high officers,
who are jealous of the &lsquo;American,&rsquo; as he is
styled, and their readiness to precipitate a contest;
and Armand&rsquo;s contingent is unduly weak, because
they do not feel assured that he would countenance
war. In a word, the rogues and rascals are for
Lotzen&mdash;they recognize a kindred leader and the
opportunity for high reward. But they would accept
you for Queen with enthusiasm&mdash;even rogues
and rascals love a pretty woman who can rule them
with a heavy hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>Dehra looked at her hand, slender, soft, small,
and smiled.</p>
<p>Count Epping nodded. &ldquo;Very pretty,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;very pretty, but it&rsquo;s a Dalberg hand, you know&mdash;and
they know, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as they shall experience,&rdquo; she remarked,
eyelids narrowed just a trifle, &ldquo;if they show a disposition
to forget it.... And in the experience
they may learn that the Governor of
Dornlitz also has a Dalberg hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no civil war now,&rdquo; said the
Count; &ldquo;your regency has quite obviated any such
catastrophe; and if the Book be found, its decision
will be accepted without protest by the Army, as
well as by the people at large. What I fear is the
contest in the House of Nobles&mdash;the margin there
will be very narrow, I apprehend; and that involves
high feeling and fierce antagonism and smoldering
family hate fanned into fire; and then, if Lotzen
lose, the new king may have a chance to show his
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Armand the First will show it, never fear,&rdquo;
she said, with the pride a woman always has for
him she loves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no fear,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;if I had, I would
not help to make him king&mdash;yet, if I may be permitted,
Henry the Fifth would be a title far more
pleasing to the nation than Armand the First. He
bears the Great Henry&rsquo;s features, let him bear his
name, as well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>She sprang up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall, he shall!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;he will
do it for me, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Count&rsquo;s face softened in one of its rare
smiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would be a poor sort of man, indeed, my
lady, who would deny anything to you,&rdquo; he said,
and in his stately, old-fashioned way he bent and
kissed her hand.</p>
<p>As he arose, the Princess suddenly slipped an
arm around his neck, and for the briefest moment
her soft lips rested on his forehead.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister kept his face lowered; when
he raised it, the tears still trembled in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell the Archduke,&rdquo; she laughed gayly,
seeing how he was moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, laughing with her now, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
not tell him&mdash;and lose all chance for another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you another now,&rdquo; she cried, and,
springing on the chair beside him, she kissed him
on the cheek. &ldquo;Now go&mdash;you&rsquo;ve had more than
your share&mdash;but you shall have a third the day
Armand is king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her hand, and gallantly helped her
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You give me another object in life,&rdquo; he said.&mdash;&ldquo;I
shall claim it if the King permit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You may claim it, before him and all the
Court,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>After Count Epping had gone, the Princess
turned to the table, and sitting on the corner, one
foot on a chair, the other dangling, took up some
papers he had left with her for examination. In
the midst of it the Duke of Lotzen was announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am engaged,&rdquo; she said curtly; &ldquo;I cannot
see him ... or stay, admit him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After her question and his answer in the garden
near the sun-dial, two days before, she had decided
she would receive him only upon occasions of ceremony,
when, to exclude him, would have required
a special order; but this unexpected and, for him,
amazingly early visit, piqued her curiosity too
sharply to resist.</p>
<p>But there was no cordiality in her look nor attitude,
as he bowed before her in the intensely respectful
manner he could assume so well. She made
no change in her position, nor offered him her hand,
nor smiled; her eyes showed only polite indifference
as, for a space, she let him wait for leave to speak.
When she gave it, her voice was as indifferent as
her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Your Royal Highness,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how
can we serve you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a shade of her bearing had missed the Duke,
and though his anger rose, yet his face bore only
a placid smile of amused unconcern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I desire the Regent&rsquo;s permission,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to
absent myself from the country for an indefinite
period.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is granted&mdash;a year, if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke laughed softly, almost mockingly,
indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear I may not stay quite so long,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;much as it would please me to oblige you.
My presence will be necessary in a certain ceremony
in the Cathedral, that is fixed for a few weeks
short of a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Regent&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. &ldquo;In the crypt,
you mean?&mdash;your absence will, at least, postpone
the ceremony&mdash;had you remained, I imagine it
would have occurred much earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Lotzen&rsquo;s calmness was disturbed by such
a threat from a woman&mdash;and, momentarily, his
color heightened and his eyes snapped in irritated
surprise. Then he bowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to have been shown the claws so
early,&rdquo; he replied with sneering sarcasm; &ldquo;I shall
endeavor to keep beyond their reach. But I shall
do my best to furnish the crypt another tenant,
though I will not promise to put my Court in
mourning for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess shrugged her shapely shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite unnecessary to tell us what your barbaric
nature told us long ago,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;When
do you wish to depart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for where?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For France&mdash;Paris in particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well&mdash;prefer your request through the
regular channel, as any other officer, and I will
grant it;&rdquo; and with a perfunctory nod, she resumed
her reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am permitted to withdraw?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are always permitted to withdraw,&rdquo; she
answered, without looking up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like your spirit, Dehra,&rdquo; he laughed; &ldquo;you
and I would make an unconquerable pair; it is a
pity you won&rsquo;t be my queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, sir,&rdquo; she ordered, her voice repressed to
unusual softness; &ldquo;go! nor present yourself again
until you have received permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with a smile and a bow, he went; backing
slowly from the room, in an aggravation of respect.</p>
<p>He had not come to the Palace for leave to go
to France, or any where else; where he wanted to
go, and when, he went. But his plans required that
he be absolutely free and untrammeled, and so he
had done this to insure himself against being ordered
suddenly to some military duty that might
hamper his movements even slightly. And his visit
had been doubly successful&mdash;he had the permission,
and in such a form that he was given the utmost
liberty, and he had also learned the Regent&rsquo;s real
attitude toward him, and that even with her it
would be a fight without quarter. What the American
would make it, the dead bodies in the De Saure
house had indicated as plainly as spoken words&mdash;and,
indeed, as such he knew they had been deliberately
intended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>As he passed one of the windows in the corridor,
he caught, far off amid the trees, the sheen of a
white gown; he paused, and presently he recognized
Mlle. d&rsquo;Essold&eacute;. With a smile of sudden purpose,
he went quickly down a private stairway that
opened on the Park below the marble terrace, and,
eyes on the white gown, that showed at intervals
through the bushes, he sauntered toward it.</p>
<p>There was, to be sure, a woman with raven hair
and dead-white cheek at the Ferida, but there was
also a woman yonder, and handier, with golden hair
and shell-pink cheek; and variety was much to his
taste, at times&mdash;and the picture on the stair still
lingered with him, fresh and alluring. True, she
had not received his advances with that flattered
acquiescence he was rather used to, but he had no
particular objection to temporary opposition; it
gave zest to the victory&mdash;and, with him, victory
had been rarely lost.</p>
<p>He encountered her in a narrow path, walled in
by thick hedges of scarlet japonica, turning the
corner suddenly and greeting her with a smile of
well assumed surprise; stopping quite a little way
off and bowing, his cap across his heart.</p>
<p>And she stopped, also; touched by fear and repugnance,
as though a snake lay in her path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A happy meeting, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For whom, sir?&rdquo; she asked, turning half away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me,&rdquo; he laughed, going toward her; &ldquo;and
for you, too, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her back to the hedge and made no
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe you a very abject apology, for the other
day,&rdquo; he said, standing close beside her, and leaning
on his sword. &ldquo;I fear I was brutally rude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t the least doubt of it,&rdquo; she replied,
and made to pass on.</p>
<p>He stepped before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are so still,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Elise,&rdquo; he smiled, still blocking the way,
&ldquo;come; forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I forgive you,&rdquo; she said, indifferently,
and tried again to pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, my dear,&rdquo; catching her wrist, &ldquo;put
a bit of warmth into it&mdash;and then prove it by a
little stroll with me toward the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She recoiled at his touch, much as though the
snake had stung her, and tried to wrench free,
tearing her thin gown and scarring her flesh on the
sharp thorns of the japonica, but making no outcry.</p>
<p>And this encouraged Lotzen; she was playing
it very prettily indeed&mdash;to yield presently, the
weary captive of superior strength. That a woman
might be honest in her resistance, he was always
slow to credit; but that one should actually be honest,
and yet struggle silently rather than permit
others to see her with him, was quite beyond his
understanding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>He glanced up and down the path; no one was
in sight, and the hedge was high&mdash;he would make
the play a little faster. Hitherto, he had been content
to hold her with a sure grip, and let her fling
about in futile strivings; now he laughed, and drew
her slowly toward him, his eyes fixed significantly
upon her flushed face and its moist red lips, parted
with the breath-throbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall I kiss you first, little one?&rdquo; he
asked&mdash;&ldquo;on the mouth, or a check, or the gleaming
hair?&rdquo;&mdash;He held her back an instant in survey....
&ldquo;Coy?&mdash;too coy to answer&mdash;come, then,
let it be the lips now, and the others later, by the
lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had ceased to struggle, and her blue eyes
were watching the Duke in fascinated steadiness.
To him, it signified victory and a willing maid&mdash;he
took a last glance at the path&mdash;then with a
cry and a curse he dropped her wrist and sprang
back, wringing his hand, the blood gushing from
a ragged wound across its back, where Elise d&rsquo;Essold&eacute;&rsquo;s
teeth had sunk into the flesh.</p>
<p>And she, with high-held skirts, was flying toward
the Palace.</p>
<p>He sprang in pursuit&mdash;and stopped; she would
pass the hedge before he could overtake her; and
the open Park was no place for love making of the
violent sort&mdash;nor with a wound that spurted red.
The business would have to bide, for the present....
Over toward the terrace he saw the
flutter of a white gown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Damn the little cat!&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;she shall
pay me well for this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elise d&rsquo;Essold&eacute;, spent with running, her brain
in a whirl, her hair dishevelled, weak-kneed and
trembling now with the reaction, reached the marble
steps near the pergola and sank on the lowest, just
as Colonel Moore came springing down them, his
eyes toward the japonica walk, searching for the
girl in a white gown whom he was to have met
there half an hour ago.</p>
<p>And he would have passed, unseeing, had she not
spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Ralph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swung around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elise!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to be so
late&mdash;I was&mdash;heaven, child, what has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sight of him, and the sound of his voice,
had calmed her instantly and put her pulse to normal
beating; and now that she was with him, safe
and unscathed, the coquette in her could not resist
the temptation to torment him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another kept the rendezvous,&rdquo; she answered,
with affected na&iuml;vet&eacute;.</p>
<p>He pointed to the torn gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the hair?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The penalty of an ill-arranged coiffure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the red mark on your face&mdash;blood, it
looks like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;blood? where&mdash;where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On your lips&mdash;around the mouth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coquette vanished&mdash;the horror of it all
flashed back upon her:&mdash;Lotzen&rsquo;s sybaritic leer&mdash;his
easy confidence of assured success&mdash;the touch of
his loathsome hand to her face&mdash;the sickening sensation
as her teeth cut through his flesh and scraped
the bones beneath&mdash;with a cry of disgust she
sprang up, swayed unsteadily, and would have
fallen had not Moore caught her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water!&rdquo; she implored, &ldquo;water!&rdquo; rubbing her
lips frantically with her handkerchief&mdash;&ldquo;water,
oh, water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amazed&mdash;mystified&mdash;alarmed, he stood an instant
irresolute&mdash;then swinging her up, he bore
her to where, near the sun-dial, a fountain played
and splashed among the giant ferns. As they
reached there, the nervous tumult subsided as
quickly as it came, and she slipped swiftly out of
his arms, and knelt beside the fountain, the spray
powdering her hair with rainbow dust. And when
she had bathed her face free of the blood-stain&mdash;though
she could not wash away the red of her
own embarrassment&mdash;she ventured to look at him.</p>
<p>He met her with a smile, that showed only sharp
concern and tenderest sympathy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; he said, taking her hand, in the
most gentle deference, and holding it in both of
his, &ldquo;tell me what has unstrung you so completely&mdash;you
who are always merry and serene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gently freed her hand, and, gathering up
the trailing ends of her skirt, turned toward the
Palace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I tell you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;promise me that you
won&rsquo;t make a scene nor try to punish him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him!&rdquo; he exclaimed, stopping short, &ldquo;him!
God in Heaven, was it that devil, Lotzen?&rdquo;&mdash;he
seized her arm&mdash;&ldquo;where is he&mdash;where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled at him very sweetly, loving the anger
that blazed his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you nothing,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;so long
as you are in that humor&mdash;your promise first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;I promised and forbore the other
day; but now, with that&rdquo;&mdash;sweeping his hand at
gown and hair&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll forbear no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moved on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Elise, who was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him another smile, but shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it Lotzen&mdash;tell me, was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the smile, and the motion of refusal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, if you won&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll find out for
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot&mdash;the man won&rsquo;t tell&mdash;and no one
saw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed with quiet menace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find him,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Quick fear seized her. He would succeed, she
knew; and then, what would he do! Something,
doubtless, to try to force the Duke to fight; and
which would result only in his own disgrace and in
being driven from the country. He must not suffer
for her misfortune&mdash;and Dornlitz, without her dear
Irishman, would be impossible; and she was not yet
quite ready to go with him. She had told him something&mdash;as
much as she might with proper reserve&mdash;of
Lotzen&rsquo;s behavior that other morning; and
it had been difficult enough to restrain him then.
Now, with the dishevelled hair, and torn gown, and
blood on her face, only his own word would hold
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise me, Ralph, promise me,&rdquo; she implored;
&ldquo;there is no reason for punishment&mdash;see,&rdquo; holding
out her hand, &ldquo;here is the only place he touched
me&mdash;only on the wrist&mdash;I swear it, Ralph&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the hand, and looked at the soft, blue-veined
flesh, chafed and abraded with the pinch of
iron fingers; and again the rage of hate swept
him, and he put the hand down sharply and turned
away his head, unwilling that she should see his
face while passion marked it.</p>
<p>She touched his arm, almost timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise me, dear,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;please promise
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not realize what she had called him; nor,
indeed, did he, until days afterward, too late to
turn it to account; though what he answered worked
far more to his profit, than had he used the chance
offered by an inadvertent endearment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I ought not to; but because
you wish it, I promise&mdash;now will you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at him gratefully&mdash;and such
women as Elise d&rsquo;Essold&eacute; can say much with their
eyes. They had mounted the steps and were on
the terrace; she pointed into the Park.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in the japonica walk,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I
was waiting for you, when Lotzen came upon me,
seemingly by accident&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no accidents with Lotzen,&rdquo; Moore
broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be, but he chose to treat it so;&mdash;I tried
to pass&mdash;he stopped me and begged forgiveness
for his brutal rudeness of the other day; I forgave
him indifferently, hoping to escape quickly, and
tried again to pass. He caught my wrist, and
demanded a kiss, and that I walk with him to the
lake. I was close against the hedge, and it was in
my struggles to get free from him that the sharp
thorns tore my gown. He let me thrash out my
strength, holding me all the time by this wrist;
presently, when he was about to kiss me by main
force, I bit him in the hand, and escaped, running
at top speed, and in fright and exhaustion collapsing
where you found me.... That was
all, Ralph,&rdquo; she ended.</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s intense repression found some relief in
a long breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All!&rdquo; he said, rather huskily; &ldquo;all! ...
well, all I ask is, some day, to have him against me,
sword in hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your promise!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>He smiled down at her. &ldquo;The promise holds,
child, as you well know; but this affair of the
Book may work an opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it does, take it,&rdquo; said she instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me, my lady,&rdquo; he answered, as he left
her at the small door used only by the Princess
and her privileged intimates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your lady?&rdquo; she echoed across the sill&mdash;her
natural witchery increased four-fold, in his eyes,
by the tumbled hair&mdash;&ldquo;your lady&mdash;perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the hallway, just at her own room, she met
the Princess, who, woman-like, marked at a glance
every detail of her disordered attire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heaven, Elise,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;what
has that Adjutant of mine been doing to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practicing sword tricks on my skirt,&rdquo; said she,
holding it up to show the rents, &ldquo;and learning to
be <i>un coiffeur</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to be as uncommonly proficient in
the one as he is deficient in the other,&rdquo;&mdash;then
looked at her questioningly; &ldquo;but seriously, Elise,
what happened?&mdash;if you care to tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Duke of Lotzen found me alone in the
japonica walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess struck her hands together angrily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lotzen! oh, Lotzen!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;some
day&mdash;did Moore come on him there? If he did,
the some-day is already here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately, no, since I escaped unharmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, you mean&mdash;it saved to the
world another scoundrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Ralph would be a fugitive in disgrace,&rdquo;
said Mlle. d&rsquo;Essold&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the Lion and a Brigadier&rsquo;s commission
as a punishment,&rdquo; the Regent answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wanted to go back, and it was I that kept
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a misfortune&mdash;more than a misfortune;
it&rsquo;s almost a calamity&mdash;my dear Elise, if ever again
your Colonel get so proper an excuse to kill that
devil, pray don&rsquo;t intervene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;very sorry, I&rsquo;m almost criminally
stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, dear,&rdquo; said the Princess; &ldquo;there will
be other chances&mdash;meanwhile, what happened?...
Bit him! Oh, delightful, delightful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other gave a shiver of repugnance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disgusting, I should call it, now&mdash;I did it in
the frenzy to be free. I shall never forget the
horrible thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor will he&mdash;you&rsquo;ve marked him for life&mdash;the
pity is it wasn&rsquo;t his face.&mdash;Go on; what happened
then?&rdquo;...</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The nasty brute,&rdquo; said Dehra, when she had
heard the last detail&mdash;&ldquo;and save for the punishment
you yourself administered, he, for the time,
must go scatheless; you cannot permit such a story
to go through the Court and the Clubs; and you
may be quite sure he won&rsquo;t tell it.&rdquo; She struck her
hands together vehemently. &ldquo;Lotzen! oh Lotzen!&mdash;Some
day, Elise, your lover or mine is going to
be granted the blessed privilege of putting a sword
through his vile heart.&rdquo; She sprang up. &ldquo;Come,
dear, you need diversion&mdash;we will ride; and if I
can get the Archduke, we&rsquo;ll take your Colonel, too.&rdquo;
She went to the telephone.... &ldquo;Is
that you, Armand?&rdquo;&mdash;when the recall bell rang....
&ldquo;This is Dehra&mdash;Elise and I are off
for a ride; if you can go with us, I&rsquo;ll have Moore
go, too.... Bother your important appointment;
break it.... You can&rsquo;t?...
We can be back by four o&rsquo;clock....
Have matters to see to; will they occupy
all the afternoon?... They will?...
And you need Moore, also?&mdash;all right,
take him&mdash;what is your appointment?...
Can&rsquo;t tell me over telephone?... Tell me
to-night&mdash;well, I suppose I can wait&mdash;come for dinner....
Yes, stupid.... Good-bye,
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hung up the receiver. &ldquo;You heard, Elise;
neither of them can go. I should hate to be a man
and always busy. Come, we will go ourselves, and
make an afternoon of it&mdash;and stop at the Twisted
Pines for tea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<h2 id="c14">XIV
<br /><span class="small">AN ENTICING RENDEZVOUS</span></h2>
<p>The failure of Colonel Moore to keep promptly
his appointment with Mlle. d&rsquo;Essold&eacute; to meet her
that morning in the japonica walk was due to a
letter that had come to him in the early post, and
which had sent him, without a moment&rsquo;s delay,
straight to Dornlitz and Headquarters; nor did he
even stop to telephone the Archduke, but left it
for one of the young officers in the outer office to
do.</p>
<p>The Military Governor received him at once, and
with a look of questioning concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything wrong at the Palace?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Your Highness,&rdquo; said Moore, with
his graceful salute&mdash;so unlike Bernheim&rsquo;s stiff motion&mdash;&ldquo;nothing;
I brought this letter; it is for
you, though sent to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke took it, without comment&mdash;he
knew it must be of peculiar importance to bring
Moore in person at that hour. When he had read
it, he looked carefully at the envelope, and turning
on his desk lamp, he spread the letter under it and
examined it very slowly and critically; finally he
re-read it aloud:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If His Royal Highness the Archduke Armand
wish to know the whereabouts of a certain Book,
let him be at the Inn of the Twisted Pines at four
o&rsquo;clock this afternoon. No harm is intended; and as
a proof he is privileged to bring as large an escort
as he desires. If he accept, let him stand in a window
of his private office, overlooking the Avenue, for
five minutes at exactly noon to-day. This is his only
chance; there will be no second letter.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;&lsquo;One Who Knows.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the writer at least knows how
to put up a very enticing bait&mdash;&lsquo;privileged to bring
as large an escort as he desires&mdash;at four o&rsquo;clock
this afternoon&mdash;at the Inn of the Twisted Pines&rsquo;&mdash;surely,
there is nothing in them to suggest danger,
daggers or death.... I think we
shall accept, Colonel; what&rsquo;s your notion about
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is a plant,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a very clever
one&mdash;and hence spells Lotzen; but, for my part,
I&rsquo;ll be charmed to go with you, whatever it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke smiled. &ldquo;Of course you will,
you peaceful citizen, and be sadly disappointed if
there isn&rsquo;t a head for you to hit. It&rsquo;s just as well
I gave you to the Regent, you would be leading me
into all sorts of danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Your Highness has established such a
splendid reputation for avoiding danger,&rdquo; Moore
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did it never occur to you, sir, that the man
who would deliberately force a sword fight with the
Duke of Lotzen, has won a name for reckless courage
that he can never live down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I disarmed him, thanks to your defense to
his <i>coup</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small good would my defense have been to one
who hadn&rsquo;t the nerve and skill to use it; to fail
means death, as you, of course, appreciated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke nodded. &ldquo;But the public knew
nothing of all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so, sir&mdash;all they know is that you, in sheer
deviltry, took your chances against one of the two
best swordsmen in Valeria; that you won, demonstrated
your skill, but it didn&rsquo;t disprove the recklessness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not intend it that way, Moore; I assure
you I had no idea of bringing on a fight that night
at the Vierle Masque, when I went over to him and
the Spencer woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A broad grin overspread the Irishman&rsquo;s handsome
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t make a single officer believe it,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;and seriously, sir. I wouldn&rsquo;t try. It
is just such a thing as your great ancestor would
have done, and it has caught the youngsters as
nothing else ever could; they swear by you&mdash;only
last night, I heard a dozen of them toast you uproariously
as the next king.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which brings us back to the Book and this
letter,&rdquo; Armand remarked; &ldquo;shall we take an
escort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a rather incompetent adviser, you think;
but the very provision that you need not go alone,
may be a trap to lull suspicion and bring you there
with only an Aide or an orderly. If the letter is
honest, it will be no harm to go well attended; if
it isn&rsquo;t honest, you will lose nothing, and the escort
may be very useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are becoming a very Fabius in discretion,&rdquo;
the Archduke smiled; &ldquo;and we will take the escort.&rdquo;
He considered a moment. &ldquo;Or, rather, we will
have it on hand for need. I&rsquo;ll see to it that a troop
of Lancers shall be passing the Inn a little before
four o&rsquo;clock, and halt there, while their captain
discusses the weather with the landlord. And we
will ride up with a great show of confidence or
contempt, whichever way the One Who Knows may
view it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell Her Highness of the letter, and
your purpose?&rdquo; Moore asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life, man! She would send a
Brigade with us, even if she didn&rsquo;t forbid our
going. I&rsquo;ll get you leave for the afternoon&mdash;and
not a word to Bernheim, either; he would have nervous
prostration, and load me down with a suit of
plate-mail and a battle-axe. You and I will just
have this little adventure on the side.&rdquo; He got up.
&ldquo;I tell you what it is, Moore, the pair of us could
make a brisk fight of it if we had to&mdash;hey, man?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>The Irishman laughed joyously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And may we have to, sir!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;may
we have to!&rdquo;&mdash;and made as though he were sending
home a finishing thrust.</p>
<p>The Archduke shook his head. &ldquo;There can&rsquo;t
be any doubt of it; you would have a most dangerous
influence over me; it is well you&rsquo;re with
the Regent. But for this afternoon, I suggest
that you select your favorite sword, and see that
it doesn&rsquo;t drag in the scabbard&mdash;and half-after-two
at the Titian gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moore paused at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Your Highness will wear
the steel vest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wear it,&rdquo; was the answer; and the Colonel
went out, wondering at the ready acquiescence,
where he had anticipated a curt refusal. Before
he had crossed the ante-room, the Archduke called
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you were surprised,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I had
a little adventure the other night that you don&rsquo;t
know about. Sit down a minute, and I&rsquo;ll tell you
of Bernheim&rsquo;s and my visit to the De Saure house
at two in the morning.&rdquo;...</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always said Bernheim was the man for a close
pinch,&rdquo; Moore remarked, at the end, &ldquo;but he is
even better than I imagined. The chest is simply
delicious.&rdquo; He paused, in sudden thought. &ldquo;And,
now, I reckon I understand why Count Bigler has
his ear done up in surgeon&rsquo;s plaster. I noticed
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
it at the Club yesterday, and heard him explain it
as a &lsquo;sore.&rsquo; To-morrow, I&rsquo;ll ask him if he caught
the &lsquo;sore&rsquo; in the De Saure house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t tell Bernheim,&rdquo; said Armand; &ldquo;if
he knows he had such a good chance at Bigler,
and then missed him, it will make him miserable
for days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Days! It will sour him for life. Next to the
Duke of Lotzen, the Colonel hates Bigler most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Moore had gone, the Archduke took up
the letter and envelope and again examined them;
looked for a water mark&mdash;there was none; went
over the writing&mdash;man&rsquo;s or woman&rsquo;s he could not
decide; postmarked at the main office in Dornlitz
at ten P.M. of yesterday; not a scintilla any place
to indicate the origin. Well, it did not matter;
he would accept the offer; and there was an end
of it, now&mdash;the solution could come this afternoon
at four. So he put up the letter, and pushed the
button for his secretary, quite forgetting to telephone
the Princess as to borrowing her Adjutant.
Then, after a while, she, herself, called him; and
as they finished their talk, the bell sounded the first
stroke of noon.</p>
<p>He arose, and hooking the frogs of his dark
green jacket, the gold braid of his marshal&rsquo;s insignia
heavy on the sleeve, he went over to the
large window, and raising the sash stood in full
view of the avenue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>It was the hour when it was busiest; on the sidewalks
a pushing, hurrying, good-natured crowd,
at their mid-day recreation; in the road-way, a
tangled mass of vehicles&mdash;not of the society folk,
they came three hours later, but the wagons, and
drays and vans of trade and traffic. He recognized
an occasional face in the throng, usually some
officer hurrying to Headquarters for the reception
he always held for half an hour at noon. To-day
it would have to start five minutes late.</p>
<p>Presently some one caught sight of him, and
saluted with raised hat; others looked up, and
did the same; and in a moment the crowd was
passing in review, the men uncovering, the women
greeting him with smiles. He answered with bows
and hand-waves; and if a bit of satisfied pride
stirred his heart and warmed his face, small wonder.
He was still new in his royalty; and even
if he were not, at this critical period, such demonstration
of esteem by the general populace would
have been very gratifying and particularly welcome.
And he stayed a trifle longer than the required
time; then, with a last bow and a wave of
especial graciousness, he turned away, and rang
for the doors to be opened.</p>
<p>It was the Archduke&rsquo;s rule that entire informality
should be observed at these affairs, and he
emphasized it by sauntering around, speaking to
everyone, and not obliging them to go up to him,
for a stiff bow and a word. He laughed with this
group, joked with another, argued with a third,
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
until not a man but had come under his eye, at
least for an instant, and he under theirs. He had
begun the receptions soon after he became Governor
of Dornlitz, more particularly for the purpose of
getting acquainted with the officers on duty under
him; but it was not limited to them&mdash;any one was
welcome&mdash;and the result had been rather more satisfactory
than even he had hoped for. There was
not an official in his district to whom he had not
given a hearty hand-shake and a pleasant word;
and as he happened to have a truly royal knack of
remembering faces, and the names that went with
them, many a young lieutenant&mdash;and indeed, not
a few higher in rank&mdash;had gone away with a flattered
heart and an ardent enthusiasm, openly
proclaimed, for the Marshal-Prince who would condescend
to remember an unimportant subordinate,
and seem glad to see him again, and to tell him so.
And the contrast it offered to the Duke of Lotzen&rsquo;s
ungracious and domineering ways was little to the
latter&rsquo;s advantage; and the fruit of it had been
ripening fast, within these last few weeks.</p>
<p>So, to-day, the room was crowded, and the welcome
the Archduke received was such as might have
made even Lotzen pause and think, had he seen it.
And this thought occurred to Armand; and he
ran his eyes over the many faces, wondering which
of them belonged, to-day, to the Duke&rsquo;s spy; for
that there usually was one present he had no doubt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>And presently he found him; and, catching his
eye, motioned for him to approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you, Monsieur le Comte,&rdquo; he
said, relieving himself from offering his hand by
readjusting his sword. &ldquo;When was it I saw you
last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Bigler&rsquo;s lips twitched with suppressed
amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Your Highness?&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I am
ashamed to confess I haven&rsquo;t been here for many
weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, surely, Count, I&rsquo;ve seen you somewhere
since then, and very recently, too&mdash;where was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bigler feigned to think.&mdash;&ldquo;One sees Your Highness
so many times, it is difficult to remember the
last ... on the Field of Mars, last Monday,
wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;no; it was in the evening&mdash;I recall that very distinctly.&rdquo;
Then he looked with deliberate inference
at the bandaged ear&mdash;&ldquo;oh, I have it: it was at the
De Saure&rsquo;s; you were there when I came, and you
left first and&mdash;rather hurriedly. It all comes back
to me now. Surely, Count, you can&rsquo;t have forgot
such a pleasant evening!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bigler assumed a look of guileless innocence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not permitted to contradict Your Highness,&rdquo;
he answered, &ldquo;but I may, I think, at least
venture the truism:&mdash;what one has not remembered,
one cannot forget.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Or restated, my dear Count, to be quite in
point:&mdash;what is inconvenient to remember, is best
denied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as Your Highness will have it,&rdquo; Bigler
grinned, and impudently fingered his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And confidentially, Count,&rdquo; said Armand smilingly,
&ldquo;while we are dealing in truisms, I give you
these two:&mdash;&lsquo;every man&rsquo;s patience has its limit,&rsquo;
and, &lsquo;who plays with fire gets burnt&rsquo;&mdash;fatally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bigler&rsquo;s grin broadened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Your Highness the man with the patience
or the man with the fire?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Study it out, sir,&rdquo; said the Archduke, as he
passed on; &ldquo;and let your master help you; the
answer may concern you both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last thing before leaving his office, that
afternoon, he wrote a note to the American Ambassador,
enclosing the anonymous letter, and telling
him his intention in reference to it; and adding
that if Courtney had not heard from him by morning
he should do whatever he thought best. This
he dispatched by an orderly; and then, choosing
a long, light sword, he rang for his horse.</p>
<p>Just outside his door, he met General Durand
and stopped for a word with him; as they separated
he saw Ferdinand of Lotzen coming down
the corridor.</p>
<p>Between them it had long been a salute given
and acknowledged, but now the Duke halted, fingers
at visor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;May I have a word with Your Highness?&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Armand&rsquo;s hand dropped slowly, and he only half
paused in his walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a particular hurry, cousin,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;won&rsquo;t to-morrow do as well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lotzen&rsquo;s eye-brows went up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t to-morrow rather uncertain for&mdash;both of
us?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Archduke instantly, &ldquo;yes, it is;
and hence what need of talk between us, at least so
late in the day. Wait until we have a to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I wish to say has nothing to do with
futures, cousin, only with the past, with the De
Saure house&mdash;oh! that surprises you, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not half as much as the amazing mess you
made of it,&rdquo; said Armand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, my dear cousin, is just what I came to
explain,&rdquo; said Lotzen quickly. &ldquo;I had nothing
whatever to do with the silly affair; it was a clever
idea, but sadly bungled; I heard of it only the
next day, and I want to assure you it was not my
work&mdash;though, as I say, it was a clever idea&mdash;too
clever, indeed, to be wasted so fruitlessly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke regarded him in speculative silence;&mdash;just
what manner of man was this; and
what could be his ulterior purpose in such an astonishing
avowal!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me, cousin,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;why
you should trouble to disclaim participation in an
outrage, whose only offense, in your eyes, was its
failure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Lotzen&rsquo;s eye-brows went up. &ldquo;I thought
you would understand that it is in justice to myself;
I would not have you think me guilty of so
stupid a piece of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless, then, it will gratify you, monsieur,
that I never doubted your complicity, however
much I may have marvelled at the unskilled execution&mdash;you
would have arranged it rather differently.
Indeed, I was sorry that you, yourself,
were not in command. I left a message, both
upstairs and down, that I thought you might
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lotzen smiled, rather warmly for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understood,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;your writing was
exceedingly legible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I sent you another message, a little while
ago, by the man with the wounded ear,&rdquo; said the
Archduke, his eyes upon the other&rsquo;s bandaged hand.
&ldquo;I suppose you got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke laughed and held up his hand, the
back and palm covered with plaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This wasn&rsquo;t made by a bullet, cousin;&rdquo; he replied;
&ldquo;I got it this morning from a new pet I was
trying to train.&mdash;No, I didn&rsquo;t get your last
message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get it to-day, cousin,&rdquo; said the Archduke,
as he turned away; &ldquo;<i>to-morrow</i> is rather
uncertain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<h2 id="c15">XV
<br /><span class="small">FOUR O&rsquo;CLOCK AT THE INN</span></h2>
<p>Ten miles out, on the Titian Road, is the Inn of
the Twisted Pines. Something more than two centuries
of storms and sunshine have left its logs and
plaster wrinkled and weather-beaten, yet the house
stands as stanch and strong as the day the last pin
was driven, and the painted sign and the bunch of
furze hung above the entrance.</p>
<p>The old soldier who built it had lived long enough
to marry a young wife, and leave it to her and a
sturdy boy; and, thereafter, there was always a
son to take the father&rsquo;s place; and with the heirship
seemed to go the inherited obligation to maintain
the house exactly as received. No modernity
showed itself within or without; the cooking alone
varied, as it reflected the skill or whim of the
particular mistress; and it chanced that the present
one was of unusual ability in that particular; and
the knowledge of it coming to the Capital, had
brought not a little trade of riding parties and the
officers of the garrison.</p>
<p>And so Captain Hertz, of the Third Lancers,
had not done quite the usual growl, when he got
the order to march at once with his troop, selecting
such a route as would bring him to the Inn a few
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
minutes before four o&rsquo;clock, taking care to approach
it from the West; and to halt there and
await further instructions.</p>
<p>He had confided to his subaltern that it was a
crazy sort of proceeding to be man&oelig;uvring against
old Scartman&rsquo;s Inn; but if it had to be done, it
was at least considerate to choose as the objective
point, a place where they could have a good meal
to eat, and the keeper&rsquo;s pretty daughters to
philander.</p>
<p>And between thinking of the victuals and the
damsels, the Captain so hurried the march that
they reached the Inn unnecessarily early; yet they
had no reason to regret it, for the tap-room was
cool and pleasant, the food to their taste, and the
girls&rsquo; cheeks prettier and softer than ever&mdash;though
it would seem that, lately, the last were becoming
much more difficult to taste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s got into the hussies?&rdquo; Hertz demanded,
rubbing his face, as the Lieutenant and
he went out into the courtyard; &ldquo;They used to be
mild enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been falling off in looks the last year,
my dear fellow,&rdquo; Purkitz laughed&mdash;&ldquo;can&rsquo;t say I
much blame the girl&mdash;I&rsquo;ve no finger marks on my
cheek, you see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted Hertz, &ldquo;solid brass; wouldn&rsquo;t
show the kick of a mule.&mdash;What in Heaven&rsquo;s name
are we sent here for any way!&mdash;&lsquo;await further
orders&rsquo;&mdash;that may mean a week.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And why not,&rdquo; the Lieutenant laughed; &ldquo;the
victuals are delicious, and the girls&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go to the devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And even father, himself, will do for company
in a pinch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain laughed, too. &ldquo;Not if I can get
away&mdash;did you ever see such a countenance? It
positively makes me ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Scartman,&rdquo; said Purkitz; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a
good man, but there is no denying that &lsquo;the Lord
made him as ugly as He could and then hit him
in the face.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the eastward, came the sound of a galloping
horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our orders, I hope,&rdquo; Hertz exclaimed. He
glanced at his watch. &ldquo;A quarter of four&mdash;I wonder
what silly business we&rsquo;re to be sent on, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hoof-beats drew swiftly nearer, but from
where the two officers were standing, the high wall
of the courtyard obscured the road, and they sauntered
slowly across toward the gateway. As they
reached it, a big black horse swept around the corner
and was upon them before the rider could draw
rein.</p>
<p>Hertz gave a cry of warning and sprang aside,
tripped on his spur, and sprawled in the deep dust;
while Purkitz&rsquo;s wild jump landed him with both
feet on his superior&rsquo;s back, whence he slid off and
brought up on Hertz&rsquo;s head, thereby materially
augmenting the fine flow of super-heated language
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
that was bubbling from the Captain&rsquo;s dirt-filled
mouth&mdash;nor did the loud guffaw and the shrieks
of feminine laughter, that came from the house,
serve to reduce either the temperature or the
volume.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the cause of it all&mdash;a slender, sinuous
woman, black gowned and black veiled&mdash;sat the big
horse motionless and silent, waiting for the human
tangle to unloose itself.</p>
<p>Coated with dust&mdash;his uniform unrecognizable,
his face smeared and dirty&mdash;Hertz scrambled up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in hell do you&mdash;&mdash;a woman!&rdquo; he ended,
and stood staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my man, a woman,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and one
very sorry for your fall&mdash;you are the landlord, I
presume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Purkitz gave a shout, and leaned
against the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Landlord!&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;landlord!&mdash;that face&mdash;oh,
that face!&rdquo; and went off into a fit of suppressed
mirth.</p>
<p>The woman looked at him and then at Hertz,
and though the thick veil hid her features completely,
there was no doubt of her irritation.</p>
<p>The Captain bowed. &ldquo;Madame will pardon the
ill manners of my clownish servant,&rdquo; he said, indicating
Purkitz; &ldquo;I am Captain Hertz, of Her
Highness&rsquo; Third Lancers. Yonder is the landlord;
permit me to call him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned down and offered him her hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand apologies, my dear Captain, for
my reckless riding and my awkward tongue&mdash;there
is small excuse for the former, I admit, but my veil
may explain the latter.&mdash;You are not hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A voice so soft and sweet must have a face to
match it, and Hertz went a step nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame can cure everything but my heart, if
she but raise the veil,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The voice laughed softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, I am afraid to raise it&mdash;your heart
would not survive the shock. Good-bye, and thank
you,&rdquo; and she spurred across to where old Scartman
was standing near the stables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am to meet some one here at four o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;has my party come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boniface&rsquo;s shrewd little eyes had taken her in
at a single glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentleman, I suppose?&rdquo; he asked.&mdash;&ldquo;None of
them?&rdquo; jerking his thumb toward the two lancers.&mdash;&ldquo;No?
then he&rsquo;s not here yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glided gracefully out of saddle, and hooked
up her skirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put my horse in the stall nearest the door,&rdquo;
she ordered; and herself saw it done. &ldquo;Now, I
want a room&mdash;the big one on the lower floor&mdash;for
an hour or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inn-keeper bowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, madame&mdash;and the gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>She considered.... &ldquo;He is one high in
rank, very high&mdash;indeed, no one in Valeria is
higher&mdash;tell him I&rsquo;m here; and admit him instantly;
but don&rsquo;t, do you hear me, don&rsquo;t tell him
I&rsquo;m a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Scartman coughed and hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But please you, madame,&rdquo; he ventured, &ldquo;if
I&rsquo;m to tell him you&rsquo;re here, but not to tell him
you&rsquo;re a woman, how&rsquo;s he to be sure you are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, O patron of rendezvous!&rdquo; she laughed.
&ldquo;If he ask for proof, you may tell him I&rsquo;m <i>the
one who knows</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s more to rule,&rdquo; he said, with a nod
and a chuckle.</p>
<p>They went into the house, and he opened the
door into the big room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what madame wishes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she&mdash;&ldquo;and remember, no interruptions,
now nor later&mdash;understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed with rather unusual grace, for one of
his appearance and calling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly, madame&mdash;does madame think I look
so like a fool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She surveyed him an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my good man, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and closed the
door; &ldquo;but I wouldn&rsquo;t care to tell you what you
do look like,&rdquo; she ended.</p>
<p>Going over to the window, she fixed the curtain
so as to permit her to see in front of the house,
and then, removing her veil, she drew out a tiny
mirror and deftly touched to place the hair that
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
was disarranged. As she finished, she heard horses
approaching, and she saw, through the open gateway,
a sudden commotion among the Lancers who
were lounging at ease by the roadside, their mounts
picketed under the trees. She knew that her man
was coming.</p>
<p>A sergeant ran in and said a word to Hertz who,
free now of his dust and anger, was sitting on the
steps with Purkitz, hoping to get a glimpse of
the face behind the veil, and staring at the windows
with calm persistency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; she heard Hertz exclaim, as both
sprang up, and, frantically buttoning tunics and
drawing on gloves, ran out into the road and swung
to horse. There was a snap of commands, a stamping
of hoofs, and the lances rose high above the
wall in a line of fluttering pennons; they dipped,
and the next moment the Archduke and the Regent&rsquo;s
Adjutant drew up before the gate.</p>
<p>The former raised his hand, and Hertz rode
forward and saluted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been here, Captain
Hertz?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since a few minutes after three, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has any one come to the Inn in that time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hertz&rsquo;s spine went cold, and his voice trembled&mdash;<i>she</i>
was the Archduke&rsquo;s, and he had dared to
ogle her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No one, Your Highness,&rdquo; he answered&mdash;&ldquo;no
one but a woman&mdash;only a few minutes ago&mdash;on
horseback&mdash;alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you happen to look at her, Captain? If
you did, you might describe her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot, Your Highness; her face was covered
with a thick, black veil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good soldier,
I see; a pretty face comes first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But her figure, sir&mdash;it&rsquo;s wonderful, black habit
and black horse&mdash;and she can ride&mdash;and her
voice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least, Captain, your inability to describe
her isn&rsquo;t due to lack of observation,&rdquo; the Archduke
remarked dryly. &ldquo;You have aroused my
curiosity; I must see this remarkable woman&mdash;and
do you remain here. I may have need of you
presently; if you hear a whistle, come to me
instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very clever, my lord,&rdquo; Hertz muttered; &ldquo;but
you can&rsquo;t cozen this bird; you&rsquo;re here to meet her,
and we are not expected. If the Regent knew it&mdash;whew!&rdquo;
and dismounting, he nodded to the
sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks about as harmless as a game of
ping-pong,&rdquo; said Armand, as they went into the
courtyard; then, suddenly, an amazing idea flashed
upon him; and he swung around, and motioned
Hertz to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What color was the woman&rsquo;s hair?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black. Your Highness, black as her gown.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>He dismissed Hertz with a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moore,&rdquo; he said, and without moving on, &ldquo;this
plot is tangling fast. Can you guess who this
woman is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The one who knows,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the Colonel
promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and more&mdash;it is Madeline Spencer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, God knows,&rdquo; the Archduke answered;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of that devil&mdash;Scartman,
is any one awaiting me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old fellow had come up at a run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness&rsquo; pardon,&rdquo; he cried, bowing almost
into the dirt; &ldquo;had I known you were coming
I would have been at the gate to receive you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the reception, my man, answer my
question&mdash;is any one awaiting me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, Your Highness&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know&mdash;what name did she give for
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The one who knows,&rsquo; sir&mdash;but I wasn&rsquo;t to tell
you, sir, she is a woman&mdash;she was most particular
as to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke laughed. &ldquo;Well, you didn&rsquo;t; I
knew it&mdash;where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will conduct your&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; said Armand,
dismounting and flinging his rein to his orderly;
&ldquo;where is the lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Scartman knew enough to palaver no longer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The large room on the right, Your Highness,&rdquo;
he answered promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Moore,&rdquo; said the Archduke, &ldquo;let
us have a look at her&mdash;and pray heaven it isn&rsquo;t
Spencer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the landlord shook his head dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer doings, sure enough!&rdquo; he muttered;&mdash;&ldquo;leastwise,
it&rsquo;s no love meeting they&rsquo;re up to;&rdquo;
and he followed them as far as the hall, to be within
call if needed.</p>
<p>Shielded by the curtain, Madeline Spencer had
watched the scene in the courtyard, laughing
quietly, the while, at Hertz&rsquo;s confusion and at what
she knew was in his mind, as to the Archduke and
herself; now she flung the veil lightly around her
head, and put her chair where the sun would be
behind her. Moore&rsquo;s presence had surprised and
disappointed her; but, on the whole, she preferred
him to Bernheim&mdash;and particularly if one of them
were to be at the interview. Though she had
rather counted upon Armand coming alone, if only
to show his contempt for the permission to bring
an escort&mdash;that he had sent the troop of Lancers
she did not credit for a moment, though it might
do to twit him with it.</p>
<p>Cool player that she was, and skillful beyond
most women, yet even her heart beat a little faster,
and her hand showed the trace of a tremble, as
she heard the rattle of swords and spurs in the
hall-way, followed by the sharp knock upon her
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
door. And she let the knock come a second time
before she answered it. She had not seen Armand
since that night in her reception room in the Hotel
Metzen, when the King and he had surprised her
and Lotzen together, and, after tumbling the
Duke&rsquo;s schemes about his ears, had sent him to
Lotzenia in disgrace and her across the border;
and, now, the sight of him, and the sound of his
voice, had stirred again the old fondness that would
not down. And though, to his face, she might
laugh at his anger and mock at his contempt, and
feel it so then, yet afterward, in the depression that
in such natures always follows periods of excitement,
the recollection of it hurt her sadly, scorn
it as she might, despise it as she did&mdash;destroy him
as she meant to do, and would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Entrez!</i>&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;<i>entrez!</i>&rdquo; and with the
words, the tremble passed, and she was serene and
undisturbed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Royal Highness!&rdquo; she said, very low,
and swept him a quick curtsy.</p>
<p>Instead of offering his hand to raise her, he answered
with a slight bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame desired to see me?&rdquo; he asked; and
crossing over obliged her to turn so that the light
from the window fell upon her sideways. And,
despite the heavy veil, that gave him only a black
mask of crape instead of her face, he was satisfied
he had surmised correctly.</p>
<p>Suddenly she caught the veil and flung it away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know me, I see,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;so we will
dispense with this covering&mdash;it is very warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a little while, he looked at her in forbidding
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ill wind blew you back to Dornlitz?&rdquo;
he asked presently; and she almost cried out in
surprise at the deliberate menace in his voice. And
Moore marvelled and was glad&mdash;the old Henry was
being aroused, at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ill wind?&rdquo; she said&mdash;leaning carelessly against
the window ledge where the sun played through her
wonderful hair, and tinged the flawless face from
dead-white to a faint, soft pink&mdash;&ldquo;ill wind for
whom, Armand?&mdash;surely not for you; why am I
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke gave a sarcastic laugh. &ldquo;That
is precisely what I should like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You doubt the letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shrug was his answer.</p>
<p>She leaned a bit toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I show you the Book of Dalberg Laws, will
you believe?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That they are the Laws, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled rather sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The facts will have to prove my honest motive,
I see; and I came from Paris, hoping that I could
render you this service, as a small requital for the
injury I did you a little while ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke laughed in her face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And for how much in gold coin of the realm,
from some one of my enemies?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She put the words aside with another smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in Dornlitz for more than two
weeks,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;can you guess where?&mdash;yes,
I see you can; the only place I could have been,
and you not know of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you mean to say the Book is in Ferida
Palace?&rdquo; said Armand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are ready to restore it to the
Regent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ready to restore it
to the Regent; I&rsquo;m ready to give it to you if I
were able, but I&rsquo;m not&mdash;it will be for you to recover
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know it is the Book of Laws&mdash;did
the Duke tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed her soft, sweet laugh. &ldquo;Oh, no, he
didn&rsquo;t tell me&mdash;he has no idea that I know he has
it; I saw it by accident&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you recognize the Book?&rdquo; he interrupted;
&ldquo;only three people in the Kingdom have
ever seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By intuition, mainly; and by the secrecy with
which the Duke handles it&mdash;let me describe it:&mdash;a
very old book; leather-covered, brass-bound and
brass-hinged; the pages, of parchment&mdash;those in
front illumined in colors with queer letters, and,
further on, more modern writing&mdash;it <i>is</i> the Book,
isn&rsquo;t it, Armand?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Or Lotzen has described it to you,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>She made a gesture of discouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are hard to convince,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;you
will have to be shown&mdash;will you take the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke smiled. &ldquo;Now we come to the
kernel,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;the rest was only the shell.
Quite candidly, madame, I&rsquo;m not inclined to play
the spy in Ferida Palace; there are easier deaths
to die, though doubtless none that would be more
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t used to be so timid or careful,
Armand,&rdquo; she mocked; &ldquo;there are no dangers other
than those of my boudoir&mdash;and if you fear them
you may send a substitute&mdash;even one of your friend
Courtney&rsquo;s secret agents.&mdash;For the last few nights
the Duke has been going over this Book page by
page; his apartments are across a small court from
mine, and his private cabinet is directly in view
from my boudoir. Send some one there this evening
at eleven, and with my field glass he can see
everything the Duke does, and every article on his
desk. Surely, that should be enough to satisfy
the most suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather too much,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it brings us back
to the question of motive:&mdash;why should you, who
have had so much of my dear cousin&rsquo;s money, and
have enjoyed his kind and courteous hospitality
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
for so long, suddenly turn against him, and betray
him?&mdash;for believe me, madame, I take no stock in
your pretty story of requiting injury, and coming
all the way from Paris to help me find the
Book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Archduke, what matters my motive,
if you recover the Book&mdash;besides, now you
can send the police this instant and search the
Palace and seize the Book, if it&rsquo;s there, and they
can find it&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t that in itself attest my
honesty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least. You know very well that
I would not venture to take such drastic action
against the Duke unless I were sure, not only that
he had the Book, but that it would be found&mdash;hence
it&rsquo;s safe to tell this story. And as your
motive&mdash;it all comes back to that&mdash;can&rsquo;t be to
assist me, it must be to assist the Duke; and so&mdash;&rdquo;
he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>It had never occurred to her that he would be
so difficult to convince; she had thought that her
bait, and particularly the privilege to send any one
to verify it, and her description of the Book, would
capture him instantly. But she had failed to appreciate
how thoroughly Armand despised her, and
how deeply he mistrusted her, and, more than all,
how intensely repugnant it would be to accept a
service from her, or to have any dealings with her
except <i>&agrave; outrance</i>.</p>
<p>She bent forward and looked him in the eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why might it not be to assist myself?&rdquo; she
asked&mdash;&ldquo;to revenge myself, if you please,
Armand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he said questioningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ferdinand of Lotzen and I have come to the
parting place,&rdquo; she said with quick bitterness&mdash;&ldquo;the
brute struck me yesterday; no man ever did
so twice&mdash;and none ever once, that I didn&rsquo;t
punish promptly. I did come from Paris thinking
I might aid you, for some how I was sure he had
that book; he was glad enough to have me; and
then he was so kind and liberal I&mdash;you won&rsquo;t believe
it I know, Armand, but it&rsquo;s true&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t bring
myself to betray him; nor should I, but for yesterday.
Now I want revenge; and I can get it
quickest and best through you. There, you have
my true motive; and even you should not doubt it,
for, God knows, a woman hates to confess that a
man has struck her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned away and looked through the window,
her fingers playing nervously on the sill; while
the Archduke, doubtful, yet half convinced, glanced
at Moore uncertainly.</p>
<p>Instantly the Colonel motioned to accept, and
that he would go to the Ferida; and Armand
smiled, and indicated that both would go&mdash;if any
went; then he crossed to the great fireplace and
stood before it, staring thoughtfully into the cinders.
Suddenly he straightened his shoulders, and
faced around&mdash;and Moore knew that the decision
was made, and finally.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Spencer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will lay aside
the questions of motive and personality: You, an
individual, come to me, the Governor of Dornlitz,
and offer information which, if true, will lead to
the recovery of an article of great value, that
belongs to the Government and has mysteriously
disappeared. It is my duty, as Governor, to investigate
the story, and I will do it, either in person
or by subordinate. If the story be true, and the
article in question be recovered by your aid, then
you will be entitled to the proper thanks of the
Government and a suitable recompense.&mdash;So much
for that. But I also wish to assure you that Armand
Dalberg, himself, declines your offer and
your aid; and should your information result to
his personal profit and advancement, it will be a
life-long regret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She heard him without turning&mdash;and Moore
thought he detected the faintest shiver at the end;
and, in truth, the words and tone were enough to
chill even a colder heart than hers.</p>
<p>But when she faced him, it was with one of the
soft and caressing smiles she could use with such
fatal fascination, and which made Moore catch his
breath and stare, though it touched the Archduke
not at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thank His Royal Highness, the Governor of
Dornlitz,&rdquo; she said, dropping him another curtsy,
&ldquo;for his consideration and trust, and the promised
reward; the latter I decline.... As for
Armand Dalberg, I can assure him he will owe me
no obligation: it will give me a life-long pleasure
to be the means of causing him a life-long regret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke smiled indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To that extent, then, I shall feel less
obligated,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Meanwhile, let us be
seated, and receive madame&rsquo;s instruction for to-night.
I shall want the Book seen by more than
one person&mdash;how many can you arrange to admit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many do you wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three, possibly four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may bring half a dozen if you like,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;though the fewer, the less chance of
failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good&mdash;how is it to be managed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew off her gauntlets, and from one of them
took a sheet of note paper&mdash;stamped with the
Duke&rsquo;s arms&mdash;on which she had sketched roughly
so much of the Ferida and its grounds as entered
into her plan. Spreading it out, she explained
how they were to gain entrance to her apartments;
and that there might be no mistake, she went over
it again, cautioning them that it must be followed
with the most careful precision. At the end, she
gave the map to Moore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I shall not expect Your Highness
to-night,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but I hope you will send
Colonel Moore; it will be well to have some one who
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
can, if necessary, use both head and sword&mdash;though
I don&rsquo;t anticipate the remotest difficulty in
your&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A volley of cheers from without drowned her
voice. It could only be the soldiers, and yet it
was such an extraordinary thing, and with the
Field-Marshal, himself, within sound, that the two
men looked at each other in puzzled surprise; and
when the noise not only continued but actually
grew louder, the Archduke frowned and went to
the window.</p>
<p>And what he saw made him frown still more, and
he swore softly to himself, as a man does, sometimes,
when unpleasantly surprised and obliged to
think quickly, and to act on the thinking, with a
heavy penalty awaiting a mistake.</p>
<p>Crossing the courtyard, with Hertz and Purkitz
walking on either side, were the Regent of Valeria
and Mlle. d&rsquo;Essold&eacute;. And even as Armand stood
there, they were out of saddle and Dehra was running
lightly up the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send Scartman to us in the big room, if you
please, Captain,&rdquo; she called&mdash;then stopped, her
eyes fixed on two horses standing a little way off&mdash;a
Field-Marshal&rsquo;s insignia on the saddle cloth of
one and a Colonel&rsquo;s of her Household on the other.
So! so! and they were too busy with appointments
at four to ride with them. She caught Mlle.
d&rsquo;Essold&eacute; by the arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Elise!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;look at those saddle
cloths yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke followed her motion, and understood.
It was a most infernally unfortunate contretemps,
but it would have to be met, and at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Regent is on the porch,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
do not care for her to know of this meeting nor its
purport, until after to-night. Madame, will you
please be good enough to conceal yourself; the door
is the only exit, and it is impossible now&mdash;I will
try to prevent Her Highness entering here, but I
may fail; I likely shall. Come, Moore,&rdquo; and he
hurried out.</p>
<p>But Madeline Spencer only laughed, and, winding
the veil into place, went and stood by the chimney&mdash;here
was a very god-given opportunity, and
assuredly she had no notion to let it pass unused.</p>
<p>And the landlord, slumbering in the hall, had
been tardily aroused by the cheering, and coming
forth, still half asleep, he met the Princess just
at the entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scartman,&rdquo; she said sharply, &ldquo;where are His
Highness and Colonel Moore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlord awoke with a suddenness that was
painful, and which left him staring at her in silly-eyed
speechlessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you, man?&rdquo; she demanded&mdash;&ldquo;tell
the Archduke I&rsquo;m here&mdash;we shall be in the large
room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>This brought back a bit of his senses, and he
bowed to the ground, hoping to get back more of
them before he need come up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will find His Royal Highness at once,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;I did not know he was here&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been
asleep&mdash;but if Your Majesty&mdash;Your Regency&mdash;Your
Highness, I mean, will permit&mdash;the large
room is occupied, I will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, Armand and Moore came out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it would seem,&rdquo; the Princess remarked
dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame the poor fellow, Dehra,&rdquo; the Archduke
laughed; &ldquo;he did the best he could, doubtless,
and at my order. We are here on the business I
spoke of this morning&mdash;it&rsquo;s finished now, and we
will ride back with you, if we may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dehra held out her hand, and gave him the smile
she knew he loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you may,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and gladly;
but first I want a cup of tea&mdash;Scartman, the kettle
instantly!&rdquo;&mdash;and before Armand could detain her,
she was past him and into the room.</p>
<p>As she crossed the threshold, she caught the faint
perfume that a woman always carries, and which
often-times is so individualized, as to betray her
identity instantly. It was a peculiar odor&mdash;the
blended fragrance of many flowers&mdash;and she recognized
that she had known it before;&mdash;but what
was it doing in this room, now!&mdash;it was too fresh
to be many minutes old.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Armand,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what woman has been
here?&rdquo; glancing laughingly around.&mdash;&ldquo;And is
here still!&rdquo; and pointed with her crop to the veiled
figure in the shadow near the chimney.</p>
<p>The Archduke ground back an oath, and stepping
forward bowed to Madeline Spencer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will you do the Governor
of Dornlitz the favor to excuse him, and to accept
his thanks for your service? Colonel Moore,
madame&rsquo;s horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Je vous remercie, Monsieur le Prince,</i>&rdquo; she
murmured, taking Moore&rsquo;s arm, and moving with
sinuous grace toward the door. But as she passed
the Princess Regent, who had stepped aside to give
her way, the veil slipped from her face, and the two
women looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;the one with
a smile of mocking impertinence, the other with a
calmly ignoring stare, and showing, by not so much
as the quiver of a muscle, her anger and surprise.</p>
<p>And when they had gone, the Princess turned
her gaze upon the Archduke, the blue eyes ominous
in their steadiness; and as he would have spoken,
she repelled him with an imperious gesture, and
gave him her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Elise!&rdquo; she said, and left the room.</p>
<p>In the courtyard, Colonel Moore had just swung
Mrs. Spencer to saddle, and was fixing her skirt.
Dehra paused in the entry until the black horse had
passed the gate; then she went leisurely down the
steps, waved Moore to Mlle. d&rsquo;Essold&eacute;, and let the
groom put her up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>Acknowledging Moore&rsquo;s farewell salute, with her
crop, but no smile, and with never a glance toward
the window, behind whose curtain she must have
known the Archduke would surely be, she rode away&mdash;the
Lancers again cheering her devotedly as she
passed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<h2 id="c16">XVI
<br /><span class="small">A TOO CONVINCING ARGUMENT</span></h2>
<p>Colonel Moore went slowly up the steps and
into the room, through the half open door of which
he saw the Archduke standing, with chin on breast
and back to the fireplace. He looked up, as the
Adjutant paused at the threshold, and nodded for
him to come in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ordinarily it would be proper now for us to
have a good, stiff drink, may be several of them,&rdquo;
he remarked, &ldquo;but the only kind that fits this
situation, so far as I&rsquo;m concerned, is straight
whisky, and I don&rsquo;t believe this cursed place can
supply it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right; it can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Moore; &ldquo;I tried
the other day&mdash;won&rsquo;t anything else do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;nothing else; and it&rsquo;s just as well I can&rsquo;t
get the whisky; I may need a clear head to night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not going, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand nodded. &ldquo;Going? of course I&rsquo;m going&mdash;why
not? and I only hope I&rsquo;ll get a chance at
my sweet cousin. We promised only to look&mdash;to
raise no disturbance&mdash;and on Spencer&rsquo;s account it
is right enough that we should do nothing to betray
her; but if Lotzen get in the way, Colonel,
we are not obligated to avoid him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why should Your Highness walk deliberately
into the tiger&rsquo;s lair&mdash;when another can go quite
as well, and without danger?&rdquo; Moore protested.</p>
<p>The Archduke took a cigarette and tossed the
case across to the Adjutant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m really hunting the tiger,&rdquo; he
laughed; &ldquo;and I like excitement in good company&mdash;though
I fear it will be a very tame affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other shook his head dubiously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not
right, sir, for you to expose yourself so unnecessarily&mdash;let
me go in command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Ralph, you&rsquo;re getting in Bernheim&rsquo;s
class; quit it. What I wish you would tell me is
whether Spencer dropped her veil intentionally or
by accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed so accidental it must have been intentional,&rdquo;
said Moore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were sure of it, that would cancel a trifle
more of my obligation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her Highness will know&mdash;&rdquo; the Colonel began,
and stopped abashed at his blunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so will Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Essold&eacute;,&rdquo; said Armand.
&ldquo;I may have to depend on you for
information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Your Highness will likely have to get it,
yourself,&rdquo; Moore laughed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not speaking
either, it seems; she let me put her up, because
the Regent sent me to her, but&mdash;I&rsquo;m chilly yet.
Did you ever notice, sir, how disconcerting it is to
think you&rsquo;re talking to a woman, and then find
it&rsquo;s a mistake and that really you&rsquo;re talking only
to yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>The Archduke smiled. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
noticed it; and we may have a rather frigid atmosphere
for a few moments this evening until I can
explain&mdash;we are to dine with Her Highness and
Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, sir, I&rsquo;ll violate propriety
and let you arrive first; your explanation will do
for both&mdash;and besides, I fancy such things are
best done <i>&agrave; deux</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fancy!&mdash;you innocent-Irishman-afraid-of-a-woman!&rdquo;
He drew on his gloves. &ldquo;Come along&mdash;put
on a brave front and I&rsquo;ll take you home.
Five minutes talk will set matters right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not talking to yourself,&rdquo; Moore
observed.</p>
<p>The landlord was awaiting them in distress and
trepidation almost pitiful. Such ill luck had not
befallen the Inn in all its years of busy life. The
Regent and the Governor! It was the end of his
favor&mdash;the end of the Twisted Pines. To-morrow&mdash;may
be to-day&mdash;would come the police, and the
nails would go into the doors, and boards across
the windows, and the big gates, that had always
swung open at daybreak, would swing no more,
and in disgrace and shame he and his would be
turned out, with the curt admonition to seek a harbor
in another land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>He almost dropped as the Archduke&rsquo;s hand fell
on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scartman,&rdquo; said he kindly, yet incisively,
&ldquo;doubtless your mind is much too occupied to remember
everything that happens here&mdash;but let me
suggest that it would be well even to make a special
effort to forget what has occurred this afternoon.
I have known such forgetfulness to merit
special reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlord looked up in bewildered joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Her Highness, sir&mdash;she will not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tush, man,&rdquo; Armand interrupted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer
for the Regent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man began to cry, and through his tears
he groped for the Archduke&rsquo;s hand and kissed the
gauntlet fervently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless Your Highness!&rdquo; he said&mdash;and was
still repeating it when the latter passed the gate.</p>
<p>The Archduke rode slowly along the line of
Lancers, scrutinizing every man as he went; then
motioned the officers to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my compliments on your
troop.&mdash;Captain Hertz, you may return to
barracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hertz saluted, faced his men and raised his
sword. And Armand, galloping down the road,
turned in saddle and with his cap answered the
wild cheer they sent after him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Purkitz,&rdquo; said the Captain, before giving the
order to break into column, &ldquo;now is your opportunity
to prove you can actually know something
and not tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yours also, O wiser than serpents,&rdquo; the
Lieutenant laughed, &ldquo;to prove you actually do
know something that you tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Archduke had not deemed it necessary
to caution either of them; here, even the dullest
witted soldier in the Army would have the sense
to hold his tongue.</p>
<p>Where the road for the Summer Palace took off
at the old forge, the Colonel left him, and Armand
went on to the Capital. He rode these last
few miles at a slow jog, and thoughtfully. It was
well enough to treat the matter lightly to Moore,
but, none the less, it troubled him. Dehra&rsquo;s conduct
had been so extraordinary for her&mdash;who had
refused to credit, for an instant, Madeline Spencer&rsquo;s
claim to be his wife, though actually supported by
a marriage certificate&mdash;that he was puzzled and all
sorts of doubts and fears harassed him. It suggested
some untoward influence; what he could not
imagine, nor how, nor whence it had come; but,
even then, everything would be very easy to explain,
if she would give him the opportunity, and not, in
the natural perversity of a woman, refuse to see
him, and so make herself miserable, altogether
needlessly. He had yet to learn that sometimes
it is well to let a woman inadvertently discipline
herself; it is more effective than if the man does
it; and usually saves him a vast amount of recrimination.
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
Then, too, he did not want Dehra to
know of this intended night visit to the Ferida,
where the natural prospect was duplicity and murder,
and only Madeline Spencer&rsquo;s worthless word
to guarantee its safety. As it was now, if he explained
at all, it would have to be down to the
minutest detail, and he could foresee what the Regent
would have to say about any such adventure
on his part. Yet if the Ferida party went he must
lead it&mdash;and the Ferida party was going.</p>
<p>So when he reached the Epsau, he was almost
hoping to find a message from the Princess that
he was not expected for dinner. But it was not
there, nor had it come when he started for the
Palace, though he waited until the very last
moment.</p>
<p>He found Moore pacing the corridor, on watch
for him, but with nothing to clear up the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve spent most of the time since I got
back,&rdquo; he ended, &ldquo;in prancing up and down here,
trying to get a glimpse of Mademoiselle, or some
one, who might give me an inkling of the temperature
inside&mdash;all on your account, sir, of course;
I&rsquo;m getting used to this freezing and thawing
process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Colonel, then we will go right in,
and you can be thawing while I am explaining&mdash;come
along, man, come along,&rdquo; and taking him by
the arm they went on down the corridor, and entered
the Princess&rsquo; small reception room next her
boudoir.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Announce us,&rdquo; said the Archduke to the footman,
&ldquo;but say to Her Highness that I would like
a few minutes private speech with her&mdash;and to
Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Essold&eacute; say that Colonel Moore has
a message from me and awaits her here....
I leave that message to your Irish wit,&rdquo; he remarked,
when the servant had gone.</p>
<p>But the man was very slow in returning, and
presently Moore laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting chilly,&rdquo; he observed&mdash;&ldquo;notice it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boudoir room swung open and Mlle. d&rsquo;Essold&eacute;
came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I do,&rdquo; said the Archduke aside, as
he acknowledged her curtsy; &ldquo;looks very charming
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave the Archduke a smile, Moore a look
of indifferent greeting, and then Armand another
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mistress receives Your Highness,&rdquo; she said,
holding back the door; and quite ignoring Moore&rsquo;s
effort, as he sprang forward to relieve her.</p>
<p>Under the chandelier, where sixty candles fluttered
their mellow light about her, the Regent of
Valeria was standing; but her eyes were on the
red rose she was slowly pulling apart, nor did she
lift them when Armand entered. Having come
in a little way, slowly and with purposeful deliberation,
he stopped, and leaning on his sword tarried
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
for her to speak; and willing that she should
not, for a while, that so, he might have this picture
long enough to see it ever after&mdash;this white-robed,
fair-headed daughter of the Dalbergs, waiting to
pass judgment on her betrothed.</p>
<p>The last petal fell; she plucked another rose&mdash;a
white one&mdash;from her corsage, and looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may speak, sir,&rdquo; she said, in voice an
impersonal monotone.</p>
<p>The Archduke bowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>She raised her eye-brows in polite surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you had requested ten minutes private
speech with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Armand, &ldquo;but I withdraw the
request; explanations are vain, when one has been
already judged, and judged unheard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One who is taken red-handed can have no explanation
that explains,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>Then, of a sudden, out flashed the adorable smile,
and she laughed, and flung him the white rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there, is your pardon&mdash;now,
come,&rdquo; and she held out both hands; &ldquo;come
and forgive me for this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when he had forgiven her, she put him in a
chair and perched herself on the arm beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Armand,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;are we never
to be free of that awful woman?&mdash;where did she
come from?&mdash;how did she happen to be at the
Inn?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And how did I happen to be with her there,
you want to know,&rdquo; he laughed.</p>
<p>She nodded. &ldquo;That more than all&mdash;yet I didn&rsquo;t
ask it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took out the anonymous letter, which he
had remembered to get from Courtney; and when
she had read it, he tore it into bits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you have the explanation that explains
now or during dinner?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She sprang up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot I was hungry! Come we will get
Elise and Moore&mdash;that girl is a rare coquette; she
makes my poor Adjutant&rsquo;s life very miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like it!&rdquo; said Armand opening the
door just as Moore caught Mlle. d&rsquo;Essold&eacute; and
kissed her, despite her struggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I warned you, my lady,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;you
would tempt me too far some day ...
will you forgive me now, or shall I do it all over
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess laughed. Moore&rsquo;s arms dropped
and he sprang back, while Mlle. d&rsquo;Essold&eacute;, flaming
with embarrassment and anger, buried her face in
her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive him until after dinner, Elise,&rdquo; said
Dehra; &ldquo;you can retract then, and resume the situation,
if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O wise and beneficent ruler!&rdquo; said Moore,
bowing to the ground, &ldquo;I agree to the compromise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>Mlle. d&rsquo;Essold&eacute; looked at him in contemptuous
scorn&mdash;though, in truth, she was more inclined to
laugh; she never could be angry with her Irishman,
for long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You savage,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you brutal savage;
don&rsquo;t ever speak to me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped forward and offered his arm, with
all the suavity he knew so well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never again after dinner, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he
said sadly; &ldquo;meanwhile, the pleasure is mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to his surprise she took his arm; and when
the others&rsquo; backs were turned, she looked up and
smiled, the impudently provoking smile he had
suffered under so long, and had at last punished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My compliments, Monsieur Ralph, on your
adroit proficiency,&rdquo;&mdash;and the tone and manner
were as provoking as the smile&mdash;&ldquo;it is quite unnecessary
to refer to what it proves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As much so, as to refer to what enables one
to recognize proficiency,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if all the men I know are like you, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now <i>that</i> is an inference I&rsquo;m curious to hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want them to be like you?&rdquo; she asked,
eyes half closed and glances sidelong&mdash;&ldquo;because,
if you do, it would be rather easy to oblige you&mdash;and
may be not unpleasant&mdash;and I can begin with
His Highness of Lotzen&mdash;truly it&rsquo;s a pity, now,
I ruined my frock so needlessly this morning, in
the japonica walk;&rdquo; and giving him no time for
reply, she dropped his arm and glided quickly into
the chair the bewigged and powdered footman was
holding for her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>No mention of the Twisted Pines was made until
the coffee was being served; then the Princess motioned
for the liqueur also to be put on the table,
and dismissed the servants.</p>
<p>Drawing out her case, and lighting a Nestor,
she smiled at the Archduke, and at his nod passed
the cigarette across;&mdash;and when Colonel Moore
looked inquiringly at Mlle. d&rsquo;Essold&eacute;, she shrugged
her pretty shoulders and gave him hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what it implies, Elise,&rdquo; Dehra remarked.&mdash;&ldquo;No?&mdash;then
ask Colonel Moore to tell
you sometime&mdash;now, we&rsquo;re to hear the explanation
that explains&mdash;the Tale of the Veiled Lady of the
Inn,&rdquo; and she looked at Armand....</p>
<p>When he had finished, the Princess offered no
comment, but frowned and played with her cigarette;
and the Archduke, ever glad for any excuse
to look at her, and very ready to be silent the
better to look, watched her in undisguised devotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plot behind it?&rdquo; she demanded,
suddenly; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it out&mdash;it&rsquo;s absurd to
fancy that woman honest, though I&rsquo;m perfectly
sure Lotzen has the Book. But why&mdash;why should
he want to show it to us? Not out of love nor
friendship, surely; nor bravado, either; our dear
cousin isn&rsquo;t given to any such weakness. So it
must be simply a rather clumsy attempt to lure
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
you to the Ferida for slaughter&mdash;and that, again,
seems unlikely; for Ferdinand isn&rsquo;t clumsy, nor
would he want you murdered in his Palace; and
as to the provision that you need not go&mdash;or that
you may take a dozen with you if you wish&mdash;and
if you don&rsquo;t go, that she preferred Colonel Moore,
or some one with brains and a sword&mdash;all that, I
say, is too amazingly inconsistent with anything
except entire honesty for my poor brain to solve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try, my dear,&rdquo; the Archduke laughed.
&ldquo;We will give you the solution to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laid aside her cigarette, and, folding her
arms on the table, surveyed him in displeased
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, Armand, you don&rsquo;t mean that <i>you</i>
are going?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He nodded, smilingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked&mdash;&ldquo;the Colonel and I,
with a few good blades, and the Veiled Lady&rsquo;s
promise to protect us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s absurd, perfectly absurd, for you to
take such risk. At the best, you are obligated only
to look, to make no attempt to-night to recover
the Book; and at the worst you can only fight your
way out of the trap. In the one case, Colonel
Moore can do the looking as well as you&mdash;in the
other, their plot to kill you will have failed and
your substitutes will be given some excuse by Spencer
and let go in peace&mdash;oh, it&rsquo;s worse than absurd
for you to go, Armand,&rdquo;&mdash;she saw from his expression
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
that her argument was futile&mdash;&ldquo;and you
know it, too; and you&rsquo;re going only because you
like the excitement, and to show Lotzen, like a big
boy, you&rsquo;re not to be dared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke laughed at her indulgently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be I am, little girl,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve
made up my mind to fight this business out myself,
and that sends me to the Ferida to-night. I&rsquo;ll take
every precaution&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except the proper one of staying away,&rdquo; she
interrupted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re struggling for a Crown,
man, and mad rashness has no place in the game.
Play it like Lotzen, in the modern way, not like
the Middle Ages&mdash;he uses its methods, true enough,
but lets others execute his plans and face the
perils.&rdquo;&mdash;She put out her hand to him.&mdash;&ldquo;Come,
dear, be reasonable,&rdquo; she begged; &ldquo;be kind; even
the wildest idea of leadership does not obligate you
to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her hand and held it, with the firm, soft
pressure of abiding affection, looking the while
into her fair face, flushed now with the impetuous
earnestness of her fear for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it does, Dehra,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;It
is our duty to the country to find the Laws and
settle the Succession at the quickest possible
moment&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And there are but three in the Kingdom who
have ever seen the Book, you and Lotzen and myself;
and there must be no question as to its absolute
identification, before you as Regent resort
to force to recover it&mdash;force that may necessitate
the taking of the Ferida by assault. Therefore,
dear, I must go, for <i>I</i> must see the Book. Assume,
just for illustration, that Colonel Moore brings a
description that seems to correspond to the Laws;
you, as Regent, formally accuse the Duke of Lotzen
of having the Book and demand its instant surrender;
and upon his indignant denial that he has
it, and his offered readiness to have his Palace
searched, you order me, as Governor of Dornlitz,
to have my rival&rsquo;s residence invaded and subjected
to the ignominy of <i>a mandat de perquisition</i>; or,
again, he may deny the Book without demanding
a search, and submit to it only under protest; or
he may refuse to permit the search and oppose it
by force. And whichever the case may be, the Book
will not be found&mdash;he will take very careful precaution,
as to that, you may be sure. And what
will my position be then, with the House of Nobles?&mdash;when
our only explanation, for such fruitless
insult, is that some one saw a book, which he described
to us, and which we thought was the Laws.
Indeed, though it hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me before,
it may be just such a condition that he is playing
for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Armand,&rdquo; the Princess interrupted,
&ldquo;would it be any advantage even if we
could say that <i>you</i> saw it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>&ldquo;An incalculable advantage, Dehra; I know the
Book&mdash;there could not be any chance for mistake;
and it would then be my word against Lotzen&rsquo;s, an
even break, as it were; whereas, otherwise, it will
be his word against our guess. Yet, indeed, in this
aspect, it&rsquo;s very doubtful if we ought to resort to
open measures against him, even if I saw the Book.
It would be a question for careful consideration
and counsel with all our friends&mdash;and it is but right
that I should be able to assure them that I, myself,
saw it, and recognized it beyond a doubt. It&rsquo;s
worth all the danger it may involve; though I
don&rsquo;t anticipate any&mdash;the more I think, the more
I believe we have solved the riddle. Lotzen wants
some one to see the Book&mdash;he much prefers it
shouldn&rsquo;t be I; he fancies I will gladly send a substitute;
and he takes me for a hot-headed fool, who
then will promptly play out for him the rest of
his game, landing him on the Throne and myself
beyond the border.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess had listened with growing conviction
that he was right; now she turned to Moore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is your best judgment?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That His Highness has the argument,&rdquo; was
the prompt reply; &ldquo;and I confess I was hitherto
of your mind, and urged him, all I might, to let
me go in his stead. Now, I am convinced not only
that we should verify Mrs. Spencer&rsquo;s story, but
that the Archduke must do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And because he has seen the Book, and can
identify it beyond doubt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly that, Your Highness; such identification
is vital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dehra nodded and sipped her cordial meditatively;
while Armand watched her in sudden disquiet;
he had seen that look on her face a few times
only, and it always presaged some amazing decision
that was immutable&mdash;and not always to his approval.
When she raised her eyes, it was with the
conquering smile that he had never yet stood out
against for long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Armand,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you and Colonel Moore
have persuaded me; it is right for you to go, and
I&rsquo;ll go with you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! <i>You!</i>&rdquo; the Archduke cried&mdash;&ldquo;are you
crazy, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least, dear; only very sensible to
your cogent logic&mdash;who can identify the Book so
well as I, who have known it all my life; you have
seen it but once, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the danger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any danger, you said&mdash;and if
there were, the Regent of Valeria will be the best
sort of protector for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will have to&mdash;go into Madeline Spencer&rsquo;s
apartments&mdash;may be remain there half the
night,&rdquo; he protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And much more seemly for me than for you, my
dear, and much less&mdash;tempting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>He joined in her laugh, but shook his head and
turned to Moore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel, will you oblige me by telephoning
Mrs. Spencer we shall not be there to-night; word
it any way you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Moore,&rdquo; said the Princess sharply,
&ldquo;you will do nothing of the sort. The Regent
of Valeria requires the attendance of the Governor
of Dornlitz and yourself to the Ferida Palace this
night&mdash;and in the interval, you both will hold yourselves
here in readiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand would have protested again, but she
cut him short with a peremptory gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is settled,&rdquo; she said; then added, almost
vehemently: &ldquo;surely, you can&rsquo;t think I want to
see that awful woman!&mdash;but it&rsquo;s the only sure way
to block Lotzen&rsquo;s game. The Nobles will take my
word as to the Book&mdash;and so will the Army, and
the people, too. No, I must go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<h2 id="c17">XVII
<br /><span class="small">INTO THE TIGER&rsquo;S CAGE</span></h2>
<p>They had gone into the library for a rubber
of bridge, until it was time to start for the Ferida.
Now there came a chime from the mantel, and
Dehra glanced at the old French clock that her
Bourbon ancestress had brought with her&mdash;among
wagon loads of clothes and furniture&mdash;when she
came to be wife to Henry the Third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Armand,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if we are to be
at our dear cousin&rsquo;s rear gate at eleven, I suppose
it&rsquo;s the last moment for me to change my gown,
this one isn&rsquo;t especially appropriate&mdash;have you
anything in particular to suggest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;nothing; except that
you don&rsquo;t make yourself any more attractive than
is absolutely unavoidable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that I conceal my identity as much as
possible, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly&mdash;and the more effective the concealment,
the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laid aside the cards she was shuffling and
arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come with me, Elise?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;You can help me with the disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>Moore closed the door behind them, and going
over to a side-table poured out a very stiff drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it!&rdquo; he said, turning around, the
glass half emptied, and tossing off the remainder;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it, a little bit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s appalling to think what you would
take if you did like it,&rdquo; the Archduke commented.</p>
<p>The Colonel laughed and poured out a trifle
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The liquor is all right,&rdquo; he laughed; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
this notion of Her Highness I don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand had begun to deal solitaire, but he
stopped and tossed the cards together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Essold&eacute; could persuade
her to give it up?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t try&mdash;she, too, wanted to go.
I blocked that, however; I told her that one foolish
virgin was as much as we could look after in this
mess, and that she would best stay home and trim
the lamps. It wasn&rsquo;t a happy remark, I fear, but
it did the business&mdash;you will have to give me
another message for her to-morrow. Meanwhile,
I must go over and do a bit of dress changing
myself&mdash;shall I need a mask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; better take one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke was in the uniform of a general
officer, dark green evening coat and trousers, with
buff waistcoat; and unadorned save for the narrow
gold cord on the shoulder, the insignia on the
sleeves, and the braid on the leg seam. Because
Dehra liked him best in the Red Huzzar dress, he
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
always wore it when he dined with her; for to-night,
however, it was entirely too showy and
hampering, and he had chosen the one quietest in
tone and best suited for quick action.</p>
<p>Left alone, he tried the solitaire again; but it
got on his nerves, and after a minute of listless
playing, he sprang up, with an exclamation of
disgust, and began to pace the floor. Presently
Moore returned, in the fatigue uniform of the
General Staff, with its easy-fitting jacket, and
was immediately sent back to telephone the Secret
Police to spread a loose cordon around the
Ferida, with a dozen men loitering in close vicinity
to every gate. There was no anticipating what
they were about to encounter, so it was well to
provide for the worst. It was his duty to protect
the Regent whether she wished it or not; and
though he might not take them inside with her,
yet if the occasion arose, a pistol shot would bring
them very quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s growing late,&rdquo; he remarked, as the Adjutant
came back; &ldquo;if we are to be there on
time we must start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was going toward the bell when voices in the
next room told him the Princess was coming; and
she entered&mdash;a slender officer in a long military
coat, and a soft felt service hat.</p>
<p>The two men mechanically raised their hands in
salute, and she acknowledged it with formal motion
and a merry laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will I pass?&rdquo; she asked.&mdash;&ldquo;See, the hat
covers my hair, and its wide brim shadows my face;
the coat reaches almost to my feet, and its big
collar quite hides the back of my head; and, as
for what&rsquo;s under the coat, see again&rdquo;&mdash;and loosing
the frogs, she swung it back, disclosing the tunic
of her Blue Guards, and, below it, the close-fitting
knee skirts, and high spiral puttees of a shooting
suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is that as unattractive as you could make
yourself?&rdquo; the Archduke asked, with affected
seriousness, as he fastened her coat and adjusted
her sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as unobtrusive as I could make myself&mdash;some
day, if you wish, sir, I&rsquo;ll show you just how
unattractive I can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he only laughed, and, taking her hand, hurried
her to the carriage.</p>
<p>On the drive, he told her briefly how they were
to reach Mrs. Spencer&rsquo;s apartments, and cautioned
her, as tactfully as he could, against doing anything
which might serve to disclose her identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
simply to see the Book; I shall not even speak
without permission&mdash;you are in command, not I;&rdquo;
and she found his hand, and held it; rather sorry
now that she had ordered her Adjutant inside with
them, when he was about to mount his horse to
follow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will there be others with us?&rdquo; she asked,
presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Captain De Coursey and Lieutenant
Marsov, of the Cuirassiers; both guaranteed by
Colonel Moore to be skillful swordsmen, and
friendly to me as against Lotzen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; the Adjutant added, &ldquo;devoted
to an adventure, and in discretion unsurpassed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell them who I am?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>The Archduke hesitated.... &ldquo;No,
not unless it becomes necessary; it would only make
them unduly nervous; but if trouble come, they
must know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can protect myself, a little while,&rdquo; said she,
slapping her sword in laughing bravado; though
indeed she was very clever with the foils.</p>
<p>To her quick eye and natural talent had been
added years of careful training under expert
<i>ma&icirc;tres</i>; for, to Frederick, she was both son and
daughter, and he had encouraged her in everything
that went to strengthen body or mind. Yet she
was so very modest about it, that only very lately
had even Armand known of her proficiency; and
now, he regularly put on the mask and plastron
with her, and had her present when Moore and
he were practicing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for more than a little while,&rdquo; the Archduke
replied; &ldquo;and if you do have to draw, try to
forget you&rsquo;re fencing with pointed weapons, and
bear in mind only that you must not be touched.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>She leaned closer to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness Armand, you make me afraid,&rdquo; she
said, with a little shiver; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to fight
any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please God you won&rsquo;t have to, dear, but if
you do, remember that the surest way to save your
life is to take the other fellow&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shivered again. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t want to be
a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slipped his arm around her and bent down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me send you back to the Palace, sweetheart,&rdquo;
he whispered&mdash;&ldquo;for my sake go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for your sake I&rsquo;m going on,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;and&mdash;I&rsquo;ll kill the other fellow if I have
to&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carriage drew in to the curb and stopped.
It was on a side street near the rear gate of the
Ferida, and as the Archduke got out, two officers
in quiet uniforms and capes, who were walking
slowly along, halted, and, after a glance, came
up and saluted. They were De Coursey and
Marsov.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you for your attendance,&rdquo; said the
Archduke; and leaving it for Moore to acquaint
them with as much of the business in hand as was
necessary, he linked arms with the Regent and
they went leisurely on; there was ample time, and
they reached the entrance as the Cathedral bell
rang the hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>The great gate was closed and locked, but in
it was a small one, so cleverly hidden among the
frets and ornaments that the Archduke had trouble
in locating it, and still more in finding the catch,
which Mrs. Spencer had engaged would not be
fastened.</p>
<p>Across the street a number of men were loitering,
and two came hastily over; but recognizing
Colonel Moore, who had stepped out to meet them,
they made a quick salute and were returning, when
he called them back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be for you to see that we are not
locked in,&rdquo; he said, and following the others, who
had already entered, he closed the gate behind
him.</p>
<p>The drive ran between great oaks straight
toward the house, but, a little way in, a narrow
walk branched from it on either side and wound
through trees and between hedges to the side gates,
and thence on to the front. Mrs. Spencer&rsquo;s apartments
were in the wing on the right, and her instructions
were to proceed by the path on that
side until opposite the rear of her suite; then by
another path that bisected the first, and which,
crossing the driveway between the rear and side
gates, led to the house and close under her windows;
there, at the first small door, they were to
knock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>Eleven o&rsquo;clock was a very early hour at Ferida
Palace, and the Archduke looked dubiously at the
lighted windows and the flitting figures inside,
with the music of the orchestra, in the main hall,
throbbing out irregularly in bursts of rhythmic
melody. It seemed rather absurd for five people
to attempt a surreptitious entrance into such a
place; and again he urged the Princess to return
at least to the carriage, and await him there;
but without success; and in deep misgiving he
went on.</p>
<p>They gained the small door unseen, and, with
a quiet word of warning, he knocked.</p>
<p>From within came an answering knock, to which
he responded with two quick taps, twice repeated;
the door opened a little way and Mrs. Spencer&rsquo;s
maid peered out; then, assured, she swung it back
and curtsied them inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Suivez de pr&egrave;s, messieurs</i>,&rdquo; she whispered, finger
on lips, and hurried down a narrow but rather
brightly lighted passage, and up a stairway, and
into a room on the second floor, where she prayed
that they wait until she could announce them to
Madame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And say to your mistress,&rdquo; the Archduke ordered,
&ldquo;that it is our pleasure not to intrude upon
her until everything is arranged as intended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Spencer will respect the request, it will
be much easier for you, dear,&rdquo; he said to Dehra;
&ldquo;when we are watching Lotzen, the boudoir will
have to be in darkness, and I&rsquo;ll take care that we
leave the moment you have seen the Book.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she will recognize me?&rdquo; the
Princess asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; it&rsquo;s hard even to think what
she can do or will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least, it has been easy thus far,&rdquo; she
laughed; &ldquo;almost so easy as to indicate a trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same thought had naturally been in his
mind, and he had hoped it would not occur to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything has worked so smoothly it rather
suggests the reverse,&rdquo; he said confidently; &ldquo;but
whatever happen, you must keep with me or Moore.&mdash;Gentlemen,
I neglected to say that you will
retain your caps until I remove mine.&mdash;Lieutenant
Marsov, will you oblige me by turning off all the
side lights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently, from somewhere down the corridor,
came the ripple of Madeline Spencer&rsquo;s laugh, and
the ring of her clear voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Monsieur le Comte! I thank you
for the dance, and all the rest;&rdquo;&mdash;then in quieter
tones: &ldquo;no, you may not come in; you have annoyed
the Duke quite too much to-night, as it is&mdash;to-morrow?
well, may be&mdash;<i>tout &agrave; l&rsquo;heure!</i>&rdquo; and
the laugh again, and the closing of a door.</p>
<p>The Princess looked at Armand and gave a
faint shudder, but made no comment.</p>
<p>In a moment the maid returned. &ldquo;It is as you
wish, Monsieur le&mdash;Monsieur,&rdquo; as the Archduke&rsquo;s
gesture stopped the title. &ldquo;Madame awaits you
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>In the room adjoining the boudoir, the Archduke
left the others and went in alone.</p>
<p>Mrs. Spencer curtsied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness honors me,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, madame,&rdquo; said he, returning her greeting
with the curtest of military salutes, &ldquo;let us
eliminate unnecessary ceremony&mdash;this is an official
visit, made at your particular request; if we are
ready to begin, I will call my witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She watched him smilingly, pressing down the
roses that lay across her breast&mdash;red roses, on a
black gown that ended far below the dead-white
neck and shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a cold-blooded brute you are, Armand,&rdquo;
she mocked. &ldquo;Can it be, that the pretty, innocent,
little doll, out yonder in the Palace, has found a
drop that is warm even when fresh from the
heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her in steady threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame, I have told you I am here for but
one purpose; beyond that, even in conversation,
I decline to go. I tried to make it clear to you
at the Inn, how I would come, and why. I do
not remember your record, nor even know your
name; if I did, it would be my duty to send you
immediately out of Valeria, and under escort. If,
however, you presume to use this occasion to become
offensive, I shall be obliged to remember,
and to know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>She laughed scoffingly, and taking a cigarette
lighted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a token of peace,&rdquo; she said softly, and
proffered it to him.... &ldquo;No?&mdash;I thought
Ferdinand said he had learned it from you and&mdash;but,
of course, it does make a difference whose are
the lips that kissed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke turned abruptly and went toward
the door; another such word and he might forget
she was a woman. She might be able to show him
the Book, but, even could she give it to him, he
would not have it, if its price were the Princess
on her tongue.</p>
<p>She saw she had gone too far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Armand!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;Armand! stay&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
be good&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be good.&rdquo;&mdash;She sprang forward and
caught his arm&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go&mdash;think of what I
can show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then show it, madame,&rdquo; he answered, facing
her and so displacing her hand; &ldquo;show it; and
leave off personalities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without replying, she went to a window, and
drew the shade aside a little way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is there,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but Bigler is with
him ... ah! he is going&mdash;now, we shan&rsquo;t
have long to wait.&rdquo;&mdash;She motioned the Archduke
to her. &ldquo;See&mdash;there shouldn&rsquo;t be any doubt of
the identification, if he give you a chance to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>He went over and looked. She was right; nor
would they need the field glass to recognize it.
Fifty yards away, in the opposite wing, were
Lotzen&rsquo;s apartments&mdash;his library windows raised,
the shades high up, the curtains drawn back; and
he, himself, at the big table under the chandelier,
a twin drop-light focused on the writing pad.</p>
<p>And even while the Archduke looked, Lotzen
arose and from the safe behind him took out a
package wrapped in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Madeline Spencer exclaimed,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s it!&mdash;Here is the glass&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lingered for another glance, before summoning
the others&mdash;and Mrs. Spencer forestalled him.</p>
<p>She ran to the door and flung it wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;come&mdash;&mdash;His Highness
needs you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess had been talking to Colonel Moore,
her back to the door; as it opened, she threw up
her head, and turned with an eager smile, thinking
it was Armand&mdash;and so gave Mrs. Spencer a full
view of her face. Then Moore stepped quickly
between them and suavely bowed Mrs. Spencer into
her boudoir; the next moment the Archduke was
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your permission, madame, we will extinguish
the lights,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and raise the
shades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled maliciously, deliberately moving near
enough to see the Princess over Moore&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Extinguish the lights?&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;certainly;
darkness will be better for the business, and
will conceal&mdash;<i>everyone</i>,&rdquo; and herself went over to the
main switch at the corridor door and pushed
it open.</p>
<p>The Princess caught Armand&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She recognized me,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, dear; you&rsquo;re only nervous,&rdquo; he answered&mdash;though
he was satisfied she was right.
&ldquo;Keep your hat well down, and don&rsquo;t look at her;
the moment you have identified the Book, we will
leave; you go with Moore; I&rsquo;ll engage the vixen
until you&rsquo;re out of range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had led her to a window and raised the shade.
The lights from the Duke&rsquo;s library leaped across
the garden court at them, but he, himself, was
not visible, though on the table lay the package,
still wrapped in black as when taken from the
safe. Some one came behind them, and Armand
glanced over his shoulder&mdash;it was Mrs. Spencer,
and she was looking at the Princess; nor did she
cease, though she knew his eyes were on her; instead,
she smiled and shot him a quick glance, and
resumed the looking. He felt Dehra begin to
tremble&mdash;whether with anger or nerves, he could
not tell&mdash;and Mrs. Spencer spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness&rsquo; companion is evidently unused
to adventures, despite his uniform; he is actually
twitching with excitement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or with the temptation of your proximity,&rdquo;
Armand replied giving her his back. And Dehra
laughed softly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>Colonel Moore had been at another window;
now he came over, and, in the most casual way,
found Mrs. Spencer&rsquo;s hand and gave it a familiar
squeeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty enough to-night to give even
an old-stager like me a flutter,&rdquo; he whispered in his
most caressing tones, and, in the darkness, slipped
his arm around her waist.</p>
<p>She pushed it away, though not very vigorously
it seemed to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are impertinent, sir,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to be; it&rsquo;s the only way to get on
with you,&rdquo; and he deliberately put his arm around
her again, and rather more tightly. &ldquo;Come along
to my window,&rdquo; he urged.</p>
<p>She knew very well that his purpose was to
divert her from the Princess, but she went&mdash;nor
appeared to bother that his arm remained. Here,
was a new sort of man, with a new sort of method,
and she was, if the truth be told, very willing for
them both. Besides, her time would come
presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moore is a wonder,&rdquo; Armand commented&mdash;and
broke off, as the Duke came into view and sat down
at his table.</p>
<p>But Lotzen was in no haste to unwrap the package;
he drew it over and slowly loosed the cords,
then suddenly laid it aside, and coming over to
the window, seemed on the point of drawing the
shade; but he changed his mind, and after staring
into the garden and toward Mrs. Spencer&rsquo;s apartments,
he returned to the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>Without more ado he removed the black cloth,
but pushed it in a heap, so that it hid the book&mdash;that
it was a book, they could distinguish, but
nothing else&mdash;and went to examining some papers
he took from it.</p>
<p>The Princess stirred restlessly; her nerves were
not attuned to such tension; and the Archduke
reassured her by a touch and a word. Over at
their window, Mrs. Spencer and Colonel Moore
were whispering, and laughing softly, the latter,
however, with a wary eye across the courtyard.
The swinging cadence of a Strauss waltz came,
brokenly, from the orchestra still playing in the
great hall, with, now and then, a burst of men&rsquo;s
voices in noisy hilarity from the card rooms or
the main guard.</p>
<p>Presently the Duke put down the papers, and,
pushing aside the black cloth, disclosed the back
of the book&mdash;black, with heavy brass hinge-bands
across it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; the Princess exclaimed, &ldquo;look! it&rsquo;s
very like it&mdash;why doesn&rsquo;t he lift the cover
... there!&mdash;see, the pages, too!&mdash;it must
be!&mdash;it is!&mdash;it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run away, girl!&rdquo; came Count Bigler&rsquo;s voice
from the corridor, &ldquo;run away, I say&mdash;you&rsquo;re
pretty enough, but I want your mistress now.&rdquo;
There was a moment&rsquo;s scuffle, and the door swung
back&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;Dark! well, &lsquo;let there be light!&rsquo;&rdquo; and
he snapped the switch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>It all was done so quickly and unexpectedly that
Mrs. Spencer was caught half way to the door,
as she sprang to lock it; Armand had time only
to push the Princess away from the window and
step in front of her; while Colonel Moore, with
De Coursey and Marsov, tried to get across to
cover the Archduke.</p>
<p>But they failed. Bigler saw him instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The American!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;the American!&rdquo;
and wrenching back the door, he disappeared
down the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fool!&rdquo; Madeline Spencer exclaimed; &ldquo;he
has spoiled everything&mdash;quick, you must get away;
I don&rsquo;t want another De Saure house here,&rdquo; with
a look at Armand&mdash;&ldquo;the way you came will still
be open.&rdquo;&mdash;She hurried ahead of them through the
rooms to the stairway.... &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
honest and I want to prove it, but,&rdquo; she laughed
sneeringly after them, &ldquo;the next time Her Highness
plays the man, let her wear a mask and a
larger shoe.&rdquo; The noise of men running came from
below. &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;they are trying to
cut you off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the Regent between them, and De Coursey
and Marsov behind, the Archduke and Moore
dashed down the lower passage to the small door
and out into the garden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come along!&rdquo; said Armand; &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want
a fight; make straight for the gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holding Dehra&rsquo;s arm, he ran across the drive
and, avoiding the winding path, cut over the grass&mdash;to
bring up, in a moment, at a fountain in a
labyrinth of thick hedges and walks, none of which
seemed to lead gateward.</p>
<p>With a muttered imprecation, the Archduke
chose the one that pointed toward the winding
path by which they had entered, only to discover
that it curved back toward the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the hedge!&rdquo; he ordered; and he and
Moore tossed the Princess over the seven foot obstruction,
and were swung up, themselves, by De
Coursey and Marsov, whom they then pulled across.</p>
<p>But this took time; and now Bigler&rsquo;s voice rang
from the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make for the side gates&mdash;I&rsquo;ll look to the rear
one!&rdquo; he cried; and almost immediately they heard
him and his men between them and their exit.</p>
<p>The Archduke stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no need to tire ourselves by running,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;we shall have to fight for it, so we may
as well save our wind.&mdash;Gentlemen,&rdquo;&mdash;turning to
De Coursey and Marsov&mdash;&ldquo;to-night you are honored
above most men&mdash;you will draw swords for
the Regent under her very eye&mdash;behold!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>He lifted the hat from the Princess&rsquo; head, and
the light of a near-by street lamp, that shone
above the walls, fell full on the coils of high piled
hair, and the fair face below it.</p>
<p>Both men cried out in astonishment, and, kneeling,
kissed her hand.</p>
<p>Then they pressed on, finding almost immediately
the path by which they had entered.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the commotion in the garden near
the palace had increased, and now the Duke of
Lotzen&rsquo;s stern voice cut sharply into the night,
from one of his windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil is all this noise?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thieves, Your Highness,&rdquo; some one answered
from below&mdash;&ldquo;five of them in madame&rsquo;s apartments&mdash;they
escaped into the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke made no reply, at least which they
could hear; and the Princess laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s off for madame,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and we are
thieves&mdash;rather clever of Bigler to have us killed
first and recognized later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t see you,&rdquo; said Armand; &ldquo;he recognized
me, and thinks this is the chance he missed
at the De Saure house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later they came into the wide drive-way,
and face to face with the Count and a bunch
of a dozen men.</p>
<p>He gave a shout that rang through the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seize them!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;kill any that resist!&rdquo;
knowing very well that it would require the
killing of them all. He, himself, drew his revolver
and stepped to one side&mdash;a safer place than in the
fighting line, and one where he could get a surer
shot at the Archduke, if it were necessary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>But even twelve men hesitate to close with five,
whose swords are ready; and in the instant&rsquo;s pause,
Dehra, flinging off her hat, sprang between Bigler
and the Archduke, and covered the former with
her pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God in Heaven! the Princess!&rdquo; he cried, and
stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you play with treason, my lord Count?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;Drop that revolver!&mdash;drop it, I say!&mdash;and
you men, stand aside!&mdash;into line, so!&mdash;return
swords!&mdash;now, by the left flank, march!&mdash;fall in
behind, Count, if you please&mdash;march!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a laugh and a shrug he obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Regent commands,&rdquo; he said.&mdash;&ldquo;Attention!
salute!&rdquo; and with hands to visors the column
went by; while Dehra, fingers at forehead in acknowledgment,
watched it pass and go down the
drive toward the Palace.</p>
<p>Then she turned, and put out her hand to the
Archduke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;very tired&mdash;&mdash;Captain
De Coursey, will you bring the carriage
to the gate?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<h2 id="c18">XVIII
<br /><span class="small">ON TO LOTZENIA</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It is a most amazing situation,&rdquo; said the Ambassador&mdash;as
he and the Archduke sat in the latter&rsquo;s
headquarters, the following morning&mdash;&ldquo;and
one guess is about as likely to be right as another.
It&rsquo;s difficult to believe Spencer honest, and yet
she seemed to play straight last night. She is
of the sort who fiercely resent a blow and go to
any length to repay it. And you think Bigler&rsquo;s
interruption was not prearranged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It impressed me that way,&rdquo; said Armand. &ldquo;In
fact, I&rsquo;d say I am sure of it, if I had any but
Lotzen or Spencer to deal with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you saw enough of the book to be satisfied
it is the Laws?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To satisfy myself, yes&mdash;if that fool, Bigler,
had waited a little longer, I would have known
beyond a doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, as it is, you can&rsquo;t be absolutely certain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; at least, not certain enough to make an
open issue of it with Lotzen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney shook his head decisively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is a great misfortune you were not able to
make sure,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m persuaded it was
not the Book. As I told Her Highness that day
at luncheon, if the Duke ever did have it, he has
destroyed it to get rid of Frederick&rsquo;s decree; and
if there were no decree, then he would have produced
it instantly as establishing his right to the
Crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that be true&mdash;and I grant the logic is not
easy to avoid&mdash;what was it I saw? I would have
sworn it was the Book; it resembled it in every
particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney&rsquo;s fingers went up to his gray imperial,
and for a long while he smoked his cigarette and
stared thoughtfully at the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a fine mess,&rdquo; he said, at length; &ldquo;Spencer
mixes it so abominably. What really brought her
to Dornlitz?&mdash;how long has she been here?&mdash;did
the Duke strike her&mdash;if there is a plot back of it,
why should she have been selected to do the open
work with you, of all people?&mdash;why, if Lotzen
have the Book, doesn&rsquo;t he destroy it?&mdash;why does
he want you to see it in his very hands?&mdash;why, if
he haven&rsquo;t the Book, does he want to convince you
that he has?&mdash;... If it&rsquo;s a plot, then its
object was either the one you suggest: to tempt you
to violent measures against him to recover the
Book, and so to discredit you with the Nobles when
it&rsquo;s not found; or&mdash;and this may be the more likely&mdash;to
inveigle you into a death trap by using the
Book as a lure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either of which,&rdquo; observed the Archduke,
&ldquo;would explain his preservation of the Book.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Or sentiment,&rdquo; Courtney laughed. &ldquo;Her
Highness thinks the Duke would never destroy the
Laws of his House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy she wouldn&rsquo;t be quite so strong on
that now,&rdquo; Armand observed. &ldquo;I wish you had
seen her last night; she was magnificent, simply
magnificent.&mdash;Richard, she is the Dalberg of us
all!&mdash;it&rsquo;s she, not I, nor Lotzen, who ought to wear
the Sapphire Crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney nodded in hearty acquiescence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as she may not, it is for you,&rdquo; he said,
gravely, &ldquo;to make her a Queen by wearing it
yourself&mdash;and, as I believe I&rsquo;ve admonished once
or twice heretofore, to do that you must keep
alive&mdash;dead Archdukes are good only to bury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much alive,&rdquo; the other laughed,
&ldquo;more alive than I&rsquo;ve been since I shed cadet
gray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord knows it is not from lack of effort
on your part to get killed; you&rsquo;ve tempted death
in every dare-deviltry you could find&mdash;and this
De Saure house affair is the limit&mdash;though last
night was about as idiotic. The Princess has more
discretion in an eye-lash than you have in your
whole head&mdash;but for her, you would be surrounded
now by tapers and incense&mdash;what fresh atrocity
against common prudence will you perpetrate next,
I wonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke pushed the decanter across.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take another drink, old man,&rdquo; he grinned,
&ldquo;you must be dry, with such a warm bunch of
ideas jostling one another for exit&mdash;I&rsquo;ll promise
to be as discreet hereafter as a debutante. I admit
the De Saure business appears foolish now, but
then, at that hour of night, in darkness, rain and
storm, would you, or any other man, have denied a
woman&rsquo;s call for help? I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor anything else that promises adventure,&rdquo;
said Courtney. &ldquo;If Lotzen doesn&rsquo;t make an end
of you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he shrugged his shoulders and lit
another cigarette.... &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sworn a dozen
resolves to quit advising you; and then, every time
I see you, you&rsquo;ve gone and done some other foolish
thing, and I blow off&mdash;if you will forgive me this
time, and may be a few more times, I&rsquo;ll not do it
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Dick,&rdquo; said the Archduke, &ldquo;the one
thing I&rsquo;ll not forgive is for you <i>not</i> to do it again.
You&rsquo;re the only man in all this land who would
speak out his mind to me; and do you think it
isn&rsquo;t welcome&mdash;to have something of the old life
occasionally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while both men smoked in silence, the
Marshall thoughtfully, the Ambassador waitingly;
and in the midst of it Colonel Bernheim entered
with a letter for the Archduke, which, he explained,
he had just received, enclosed in another
envelope addressed to himself and marked
&ldquo;Immediate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>Armand glanced at Courtney for permission,
got it, and read the letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are leaving Dornlitz before daybreak by special
train, ostensibly for Paris, really for Lotzen Castle.
The Duke guessed instantly why you were in my apartments,
and what you saw. We had a fearful scene, and
he struck me again&mdash;the cur! It is the B.; he admitted
it, in his rage&mdash;and he has it with him. I am a prisoner
now, and compelled to accompany him because I know
too much, he says. I&rsquo;m not asking you for rescue, I can
manage him in a few days; but if you want the B. you
will know now where to get it. I owe you this, for the
fiasco last night, due to that fool, B&mdash;&mdash;, though I don&rsquo;t
advise you to follow; Lotzen Castle isn&rsquo;t Ferida Palace,
and I can&rsquo;t aid you there; and besides, now, he is bent
on your death, and intends to kill you at the first opportunity.
I will find some way to have this mailed, sending
it to Col. Bernheim so it will reach you promptly and
not be delayed by official routine.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;M. S.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;3 <span class="small">A. M.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without a word, the Archduke passed the letter
over to Courtney; and without a word Courtney
took it, read it twice, and passed it back; and fell
to blowing smoke rings through each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Armand presently, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re
satisfied with the rings, and it seems to me they
couldn&rsquo;t be bettered, I shall be glad to have your
opinion of the letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other shook his head, and went on with the
rings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is the use?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You are
going to Lotzenia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorely tempted, I admit&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t
know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Courtney flung his cigarette at the fireplace,
and got up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if you don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ll tell you what
I think,&mdash;throw that damn letter into the fire and
stay right here in Dornlitz; if you let it lure you
to Lotzenia, you are an unmitigated fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Book!&mdash;and Spencer only confirms
what my own eyes told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lies, lies, rotten lies!&rdquo; said Courtney. &ldquo;He
hasn&rsquo;t the Book&mdash;it&rsquo;s all a plant&mdash;you escaped
last night because Bigler blundered in, and because
the Regent was with you&mdash;but in that wild land
of the North, you will last about a day, or less.
Why don&rsquo;t you forget the miserable Book, for a
while, and get to work on your vote in the House
of Nobles?&mdash;there is where you will likely have
to fight it out any way, even if Frederick did make
your decree. Play politics a bit, and you will have
Lotzen back in Dornlitz on the jump&mdash;and the Book
with him, too, if he has it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke went over and put his hand on
Courtney&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s something worth living
for to have known a man like you, and to have
had him for a friend and companion; and if I
don&rsquo;t follow your advice you will understand it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
because I can&rsquo;t. You have called me headstrong;
I grant it, it&rsquo;s bred in the bone I think; and I&rsquo;m
not of those who can sit, and wait, and play politics.
I shall find the Laws of the Dalbergs, somewhere,
somehow, long before the year is over; and
if necessary I&rsquo;m going to kill Lotzen in the finding&mdash;or
be killed&mdash;&rdquo; he broke off with a laugh and
a shrug. &ldquo;Positively, old man, I&rsquo;m ashamed of
myself; I seem to have become a braggart and a
swash-buckler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the braggart and swash-buckler, my
dear Marshal?&rdquo; asked the Princess, entering suddenly,
with Lady Helen Radnor, Mlle. d&rsquo;Essold&eacute;
and Colonel Moore, &ldquo;not Mr. Courtney I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, no; Your Highness,&rdquo; said
Armand. &ldquo;Candor compels me to admit that I
was characterizing myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed her crop at the decanter, and nodded
questioningly to the Ambassador.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;no; it&rsquo;s only a sudden rush
of remorse for deeds past and to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To come?&rdquo; said she, and looked at the Archduke
inquiringly.</p>
<p>For answer he handed her Madeline Spencer&rsquo;s
letter.</p>
<p>She glanced at the signature, smiled, and with
a word of excuse, she carried it over to a window;
and Armand, chatting with Lady Helen, watched
her curiously as she read and re-read it; and then
she looked up quickly, and gave him the glance of
summons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you shown it to Mr. Courtney?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;Did he say what he thought of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did&mdash;and at some length, and also what
he thought of me.&mdash;Briefly, it was to the effect
that the letter is a snare, and that I&rsquo;m several
kinds of a fool if I let it lure me to Lotzenia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess tapped her crop softly against
her boot, and considered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said she, in momentary interruption
of her thought, &ldquo;I know what <i>you</i> think&mdash;you
think you&rsquo;re going,&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
and the tapping of the crop began afresh....
Presently a soft light came into her
eyes, and she flashed him the adorable smile. &ldquo;Are
you willing to wait the year for our wedding,
dear?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He bent down over her, as though looking at
something in the letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m not, sweetheart,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s why I want to find the Laws&mdash;to make
you Queen the sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Queen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine&mdash;yes, either here in Valeria, or over the
seas in old Hugo&rsquo;s land&mdash;as the Book decides for
Lotzen or for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you honestly think, Armand, that
he has the Book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Women don&rsquo;t think&mdash;they have only intuition,
and mine says that he has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall go this night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, dear&mdash;why not? Dalberg Castle
is always ready, and I shall take the Household,
or part of it. I most assuredly would not let
you go alone, to be butchered by our dear and
loving cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew it was useless to protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come along, little woman,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and
may be, together, we can devise a way for me to
get the Book out of Lotzen Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned upon him, full faced and emphatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll not go, nor shall you,&rdquo; she declared,
&ldquo;unless you promise you won&rsquo;t do anything without
consulting me. I&rsquo;m going because you need
some one to curb your recklessness; and I have no
mind to see you throw your life away just because
you won&rsquo;t take a dare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke gave her cheek a surreptitious
pinch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; he laughed; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re something
of a Dalberg dare-devil yourself when the fever
is on&mdash;and you&rsquo;re the finest little comrade and
commander God ever made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she gave him the smile&mdash;and they went
back to the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Courtney,&rdquo; said she, at once, &ldquo;we are
about to spend a short while at Dalberg Castle,
going to-night by special train, with a few members
of the Household; it will be a great pleasure
to Armand and me to have you with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am honored,&rdquo; said the Ambassador, with
a grave bow; &ldquo;I shall be glad to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if you do disapprove,&rdquo; said she lightly&mdash;&ldquo;but,
what would you, monsieur! I don&rsquo;t want
to imprison Armand, so the best thing I can do is
to go along and try to take care of him; and that&rsquo;s
where you can help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that, Your Highness, is precisely the reason
I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; he answered;&mdash;&ldquo;Warwick will
stick to his work to the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with sharp seriousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the great Cathedral yonder,&rdquo; he answered.&mdash;And
the Princess, thinking only of the coronation,
smiled and glanced with proud faith at the
Archduke.</p>
<p>But to the latter the real inference went home,
and sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crypt, you mean?&rdquo; he muttered aside.</p>
<p>And Courtney nodded curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crypt I mean,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Even Warwick
and Margaret of Anjou together could not save
the silly Henry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">[287]</div>
<p>But the old, lean-faced Prime Minister did not
deal in inferences when&mdash;having come at the Regent&rsquo;s
summons, from his office in the Administration
wing of the same building&mdash;he was advised of
the matter, and that he was to assume charge of
the government during her absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Your Royal Highness forgot the Chambers
meet this day week, and that the Regent must
open them in person?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had forgot,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but I shall return
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not for me to question the Regent&rsquo;s
movements,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but if you will accept the
advice of one who was your father&rsquo;s friend and
trusted servant, and who ventures to think he can,
at least in this instance, speak with his dear, dead
master&rsquo;s voice, you will abandon this astonishing
intention, that can profit nothing to His Highness&rsquo;
cause, and will lead him only into dire and awful
danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will there be no profit in recovering the
Book?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not recover it in Lotzenia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Duke has it; I saw it last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count shook his head. &ldquo;I feel sure that
Lotzen hasn&rsquo;t the Book; but if you are positive,
beyond a doubt, then formally demand it as Regent;
if he refuse, take half the Army, if need
be, and batter down his Castle and get it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</div>
<p>The Princess laughed. &ldquo;Now, Count, you know
very well that would be the one sure way not to
get it&mdash;he would destroy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And himself with it,&rdquo; said Epping; &ldquo;for then
your testimony would be enough to convict him,
and lose him his last chance for election by the
Nobles. It would be as effective as to find the
Book itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your plan does not please me for two reasons,&rdquo;
she answered, promptly and decisively. &ldquo;It contemplates
the destruction of the Laws of the Dalbergs,
which I would rather die than be the cause
of; and it would permit the House of Nobles to
determine the succession to the Throne, a thing
hitherto unknown, and to my poor mind subversive
of the rights of my House. What we want is the
Book, and the way to get it is to take it quietly
and by stealth. Hence, I was willing that His
Highness should go to Lotzenia, and I with him,
to see what might be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; said the Count incisively,
&ldquo;you deliberately stake the Archduke Armand&rsquo;s
life for the preservation of the Book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess gasped, and her face went white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it, my child!&rdquo; the old man exclaimed,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t say it!&mdash;think a moment first&mdash;and
then forgive me for having let my affection
for you drive my tongue too far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And instantly her anger passed; and she went
to him and laid her hand on his, where it rested
on his sword hilt&mdash;while the Archduke spoke
quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your Excellency does not quite appreciate
that the Regent is dealing with a very unruly subject,
and one who will not countenance the assault
on Lotzen Castle. Neither Her Highness nor myself
could stand before the Nobles and affirm on
honor and unreservedly that the Duke has the
Book, though we think we identified it. But more
vital still is the fact that I will not consent to
any measures which would drive the Duke to destroy
the Book. I am determined to establish my
right to the Throne by the Laws of the Dalbergs,
and not to owe it to the vote of any man nor set
of men. Frankly, my lord, I care so lightly for it,
that, but for this little woman here, and to make
her the Queen which by birth she ought to be, I
would not lift a finger nor move tongue to gain
the Crown. And if we are to have it&mdash;she and I&mdash;it
must be with all its ancient rights and authority,
unsmirched and unimpaired by the politics and
obligations of an election.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Count raised his thin, white hand&mdash;his
lean face flushed, the fine fire of a hotspur youth
glowing in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, Sire!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;go; and win your crown
as a Dalberg should&mdash;and would I were young
enough to go with you&mdash;as it is, I will hold things
stanch for you here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">[290]</div>
<h2 id="c19">XIX
<br /><span class="small">LA DUCHESSE</span></h2>
<p>Madeline Spencer, lying in a languorous coil
among the cushions in the deep embrasure of an
east window, was gazing in dreamy abstraction
across the valley to the mountain spur, five miles
away as the bird flies, ten as the road runs, where,
silhouetted against the blue of the cloudless sky,
rose the huge, gray Castle of Dalberg.</p>
<p>For the last hour, she had been training a field
glass on it at short intervals, and presently she
levelled it again, and this time she saw what she
was waiting for&mdash;from the highest tower of the
keep the royal standard of Valeria was floating.</p>
<p>For a little while she watched the Golden Lion
couchant on its crimson field&mdash;lashing its tail in
anger with every undulation of the fresh west
wind, as though impatient to spring into the valley
and ravage and harass it, much as the fierce first
Dalberg himself had doubtless done&mdash;then she
slowly uncoiled herself, and gliding from the ledge
swished lightly across to the far door, that led into
the Duke of Lotzen&rsquo;s library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ferdinand,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he
was not there, though she had heard him a moment
ago singing softly, as was his wont when in particularly
good spirits.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">[291]</div>
<p>She went to his desk and sat down to wait, her
eyes straying indifferently over the familiar papers
that covered it, until they chanced upon a
slender portfolio, she had never before seen, and
which, to her surprise, contained only a sheet of
blotting paper, about a foot square, folded down
the center. Curious, she opened it, to find, on the
inside, the stamp of the royal arms, and the marks
of a dozen lines of heavy writing, most of it clear
and distinct, and made, seemingly, by two impressions,
one at each end of the sheet.</p>
<p>What was it doing here?&mdash;and why so carefully
preserved?&mdash;She looked at the writing more attentively&mdash;and
suddenly one word stood out plain,
even if inverted, and under it a date.</p>
<p>Instantly blotter and portfolio were replaced,
and she hurried to her boudoir for a mirror. Laying
it face upward on the desk, she held the writing
over it. A single glance proved her surmise true.
Here and there words and letters were missing or
were very indistinct, but there could be no doubt
that this was the blotter used by King Frederick
when he wrote the decree the night before his
death. Her hasty reading had found nothing to
show the purport of the Law&mdash;indeed, it seemed
to be only a few lines of the beginning and of the
end, including the signature and date&mdash;but possibly
a closer inspection would reveal more; and
so she was about to copy it exactly, when she heard
the Duke&rsquo;s voice in the adjoining room and had
time only to hide the mirror and to get the blotter
to its place until he came in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">[292]</div>
<p>His cold face warmed, as it always did for her,
and as it never had done for another woman, and
he bowed to her in pleasant mockery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Duchess,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;what are
your orders for the day?&mdash;you occupy the seat of
authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She got up. &ldquo;Having no right to the title,&rdquo;
she said, giving him her most winning smile, &ldquo;I
vacate the seat&mdash;do you think I look like a
duchess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a duchess!&rdquo; he exclaimed, handing her
into the chair and leaning over the back, his head
close to hers, &ldquo;like a duchess! you are a duchess
in everything but birth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And title,&rdquo; she added, with a bit of a shrug.</p>
<p>He stroked her soft black hair, with easy fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The title will be yours when Ferdinand of
Lotzen reigns in Dornlitz,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She bent back her head and smiled into his eyes.
It was the first time he had held out any promise
as to her place in event of his becoming king,
though she had tried repeatedly to draw him to
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you do that, dear?&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;do
you really care enough for me to do that&mdash;to acknowledge
me so before the world?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">[293]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Madeline, I think I do,&rdquo; he said, after
a pause, that seemed to her perilously long. &ldquo;It
appears rather retributive that you, who came here,
at my instance, to play the wife for the American,
should thus have been put, by my own act, into
a position where our friendship must be maintained
sub rosa. You are quite too clear headed not to
appreciate that now, at least, I may not openly
parade our relations; to do so would be to end
whatever chance I have with the Nobles. But
once on the Throne and the power firm in my hand,
and they all may go to the devil, and a duchess
shall you be&mdash;if,&rdquo;&mdash;pinching her cheek&mdash;&ldquo;you
will promise to stay away from Paris and the Rue
Royale, except when I am with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wound her lithe arms around his neck, and
drew his face close to hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; she said presently, &ldquo;I promise....
But what if you should miss the
Crown?&mdash;you could not make me duchess then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, <i>ma belle</i>?&rdquo; he asked, holding her
arms close around his neck. &ldquo;I shall still be a
Duke, and you&mdash;<i>la Duchesse de la main gauche</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not suppress the start&mdash;though she
had played for just such an answer, yet never
thinking it would come&mdash;and Lotzen felt it, and
understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did that surprise you, little one?&rdquo; he laughed.
&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t forget, if I miss the Throne, and
live, I shan&rsquo;t be urged to stay in Valeria&mdash;in fact,
whatever urging there is, will likely be the other
way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">[294]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Banished?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He nodded. &ldquo;Practically that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paris?&rdquo;&mdash;with a sly smile upward.</p>
<p>He filched a kiss. &ldquo;Anywhere you like, my
dear; but no one place too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was thinking rapidly&mdash;&ldquo;duchess of the left
hand&rdquo;;&mdash;never his duchess in name&mdash;never anything
but a morganatic wife to whom no title
passed; but what mattered the title, if she got
the settlements, and all the rest. And Ferdinand
was easy enough to manage now, and would be,
so long as the infatuation held him; afterward&mdash;at
least the settlements and the jewels would
remain.</p>
<p>Truly she had won far more than she had sought
or even dreamed of&mdash;and won it, whether Lotzen
got the Crown or exile. The only risk she ran
was his dying, and it must be for her to keep him
out of danger&mdash;away from the Archduke and his
friends, where, she knew, death was in leash, straining
to be free and at him. Hitherto she had
thought her only sure reward lay in Ferdinand
as king; in his generosity for a little while; and
so she had been very willing to stake him for success.
Now she must reverse her method&mdash;no more
spurring him to seek out the Archduke and dare
all on a single fight; instead, prudence, discretion,
let others do the open work and face the hazards.</p>
<p>She gave a satisfied little sigh and drew him
close.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">[295]</div>
<p>&ldquo;May be you doubt it, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but
I can be very docile and contented&mdash;and I shall
prove it, whether as duchess of the right hand or
the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed, and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, docile and contented! never in this world;
nor do I want you so&mdash;I prefer you as you are;
you may lose me, if you change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll not change, dear,&rdquo; she whispered,
and kissed him lightly and arose.</p>
<p>He reached out quickly to draw her back, but
she eluded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, my lord,&rdquo; she smiled; &ldquo;I must not
change, you said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away,&rdquo; he insisted; &ldquo;stay with me
a little longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat down across the desk from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost forgot what I came for,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Do you know <i>they</i> have come?&mdash;the flag went up
a little while ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded. &ldquo;Yes, I know&mdash;a whole train load
and half the Household:&mdash;the Regent, the American,
Moore, Bernheim, De Coursey, Marsov, the
scheming Courtney, damn him, and a lot of women,
including, of course, the Radnor girl. For a
pursuit with deadly intent, it&rsquo;s the most amazing
in the annals of war. Under all the rules, the
American and a few tried swords should have
stolen into Dalberg Castle, with every precaution
against our knowing they had come; instead, they
arrive with the ostentation of a royal progress, and
fling out the Golden Lion from the highest tower.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">[296]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do first?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;it&rsquo;s their move. They have come
for the Book, and they must seek it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was idly snapping the scissors through a
sheet of paper and simply smiled her answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a cigarette, dear,&rdquo; she said, after a
pause, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve left mine in my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He searched his pockets for his case; then tumbled
the papers on the desk, she aiding and very
careful to leave exposed the portfolio that contained
the blotter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there it is,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;on the table,
yonder;&rdquo; and when he went for it she drew out
the blotter and feigned to be examining it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, little one,&rdquo; he said, tossing her the
case&mdash;then he saw what she had, and for the
shadow of an instant, which she detected, he hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;fix
one for me,&rdquo; he ended, and sat down,
seemingly in entire unconcern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me a match,&rdquo; she ordered, eyes still on
the blotter, as she opened the case and took out a
cigarette.... &ldquo;There, I spoil you.&rdquo; She
laid down the sheet and lit another Nestor for herself.
&ldquo;Ferdinand,&rdquo; said she, turning half around
in her chair and looking up at him, &ldquo;just where is
this wonderful Book of Laws?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, in this drawer,&rdquo; opening one beside her,
showing the same package wrapped in black cloth
that Armand and Dehra had seen in Ferida Palace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">[297]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that one,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I mean
the <i>real</i> Book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sent a cloud of smoke between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but the American
won&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She scattered the smoke with a wave of her
handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure he could tell you?&rdquo; she
asked.&mdash;&ldquo;In fact, my dear boy, do you need to
be told?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her with a puzzled frown; and
for answer she tapped the open blotter, and
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even though inverted, a few words are very
plain:&mdash;a King&rsquo;s name and a date....
And the King died the next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is your inference?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather more than an inference, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
she laughed; &ldquo;I should call it a sequitur:&mdash;that
he who has the Book&rsquo;s blotter, has the Book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had expected either cool ridicule or angry
denial; instead, he laughed, too, and coming
around to her, gave her an admiring little caress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite too clever, Madeline,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;it is a sequitur, but unfortunately it&rsquo;s not the
fact&mdash;now. I haven&rsquo;t the Book; I did have it,
and I know where it is, but I can&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had it&mdash;and let it get away?&rdquo; she
marveled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">[298]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And know where it is, and yet can&rsquo;t get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely! surely! it can&rsquo;t be that I am listening
to the Duke of Lotzen!... But, of
course, you know what the decree is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now he lied, and so easily and promptly
that even she did not suspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t; I lost the Book before
I had a chance to open it. All I know is what
that blotter tells. Damn it, why couldn&rsquo;t it have
had the middle of the decree instead of both ends!&rdquo;
and in marvellously assumed indignation he seized
the soft sheet, and tore it into tiny bits. He had
no mind that even she should have the chance to
copy it, and delve into all that the words and
blurred lines might imply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I know where the Book is, dear?&rdquo; she
said, after a pause; &ldquo;may be I could help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour ago he would have balked at this question;
but now her interests had become so bound
up with his that he could trust her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know, little one? of course you may know,&rdquo;
he said instantly; &ldquo;I shall be glad for a confidant.
The Book is exactly where it belongs:&mdash;in the
box, and it is in the vault of the King&rsquo;s library
at the Summer Palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ferdinand, dear Ferdinand!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
ashamed of you&mdash;to tell me such a clumsy lie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">[299]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a lie&mdash;that&rsquo;s the pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why all this bother as to the Succession,
and search for the Book?&rdquo; she asked incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, my dear, I&rsquo;m the only one who knows
it&rsquo;s there&mdash;listen, and I&rsquo;ll tell you how it happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last! at last! she was to know&mdash;and she
nestled close to him and waited. Truly, this was
her day. And he told all, not even omitting the
killing of the valet.</p>
<p>Her first question was typical of her mind, it
went straight to the crux of the whole matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why can&rsquo;t you get the Book?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I can&rsquo;t get at it. The infernal American
has put a cordon of troops around the Palace,
so that it&rsquo;s impossible to pass at night without
declaring myself; Moore occupies the library; and
finally the combination on the vault has been
changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it absurd?&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;the Book actually
in its place and yet lost.&rdquo;&mdash;She sat up sharply.
&ldquo;Do you really want it, Ferdinand?&mdash;because, if
you do, may be I can help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly I want it. If the decree is against
me, we will destroy the Book and go on with our
game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, dear, let us go after it&mdash;and <i>now</i>, <i>now!</i>
The Regent is absent, hence less vigilance in the
Palace; Moore is with her, hence the library is
deserted; it should be easy for you to get us in
it by day and unsuspected.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">[300]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And having blown open the vault, be caught
in the act,&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is where I come in, dear; I will engage
to open it, noiselessly, and in less than fifteen minutes,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible that you are one of those wonder
workers who can feel a combination?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;though I&rsquo;ve not tried it for
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, try it now!&rdquo; indicating a small
iron safe in the far corner.</p>
<p>She went to it, and sinking to the floor with
sinuous grace, she put her ear close to the dial
plate and fell to manipulating the knob with light
fingers; turning it back and forth very slowly and
with extreme care.</p>
<p>And the Duke, leaning against the safe, watched
her with eager eyes&mdash;could she do it?&mdash;if she
could&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="img">

</div>
<p>Mrs. Spencer sprang up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was easy,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Lotzen reached over and seized the handle; the
bolts snapped back and the door swung open.</p>
<p>With the first burst of impulse she had ever
seen him display, he whirled and caught her in
his arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">[301]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We will win now, my duchess!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;we will win sure. No burglarious entry&mdash;no
explosion&mdash;no flight; instead, the Duke of Lotzen
and his Aide will go openly to the library, and
then in a trice will we have the Book and be gone....
And I shall owe it all to you, dear&mdash;<i>ma
ch&eacute;rie duchesse</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She closed her eyes; truly, this was her day!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go to Dornlitz this very night,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;We must wait a day, little
one; until our friends across the valley have
assured themselves that I am here. But to-morrow
night we will steal away to the Capital, and get
the Book; and then, if necessary, we will come
back, and send our dear cousin to the devil where
he belongs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">[302]</div>
<h2 id="c20">XX
<br /><span class="small">THE PRINCESS TURNS STRATEGIST</span></h2>
<p>The Archduke put up his field glasses and,
turning to the Princess, waved his hand toward
the open country, and around to the Castle behind
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is home&mdash;the Dalberg
aerie and its feeding grounds. I like them well.
And particularly do I like the way the nest itself
has been kept up to the time in comforts and
appointments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do be serious, Armand,&rdquo; she protested;
&ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you any sentiment! Look at the wonderful
blue of the Voragian mountains; and the
shifting shadows on the foot-hills; and this spur,
and Lotzen&rsquo;s yonder, trailing out from them like
tendrils of a vine; and the emerald valley, streaked
through the center by the sparkling Dreer; and
the fair lands to the south, as far as eye can carry,
and yet farther, league upon league to the sea&mdash;yours,
my lord, all yours&mdash;the heritage of your
House&mdash;the Kingdom of your Fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have forgot the loveliest thing in all the
landscape,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the one thing that makes
the rest worth while.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">[303]</div>
<p>She sprang from him. &ldquo;No, sir, not here on
the wall in view of the bailey and every window;
confine your sentiment at present to the inanimate
portion of the landscape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went over and leaned on the parapet beside
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear I have quite too much sentiment,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;I have already expended far more than
you would believe&mdash;on the Castle, and the mountains,
and the valley, and all the rest. Now I&rsquo;m
done with it, except for animate objects; the business
we have in hand promises to be sufficiently
occupying. Yonder is the Book; and how to get
it, and quickly.&rdquo; He leveled his glasses at Lotzen
Castle and studied it a long time.... &ldquo;A
pretty hard proposition,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Have
you ever been in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, no; but Major Meux has been
Constable here for two years, and surely must have
been there often&mdash;yonder he is now, by the gate
tower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke caught Meux&rsquo;s glance and motioned
for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;can you give us an idea
of the plan of Lotzen Castle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do better than that, Your Highness, I
can show you a plan, drawn to scale and most complete.
I came upon it in the library only last week.
It&rsquo;s more than a hundred years old, but I think
it is still in effect accurate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">[304]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how it happens to be here?&rdquo; said
the Princess, with the peculiar curiosity of a woman
as to non-essentials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the time it was made Lotzen was also a
Royal Castle,&rdquo; the Constable explained; &ldquo;it was
very natural to deposit the draft here with the
King&rsquo;s own records.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they crossed the main hall, they chanced upon
Colonel Moore, and, taking him with them, they
went into the library&mdash;a great, high-ceilinged
room, on the second floor of the keep, the walls
hidden by massive, black oak cases, filled with books
and folios, in bindings of leather stamped with
the Dalberg Lion&mdash;and from a shelf in a dark
corner the Constable brought a small portfolio,
made to resemble a book, in which the draft was
folded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is admirable,&rdquo; the Archduke remarked,
examining it with the trained eye and instant comprehension
of the engineer officer; &ldquo;it could not
be done better now.... See, Dehra, it
is the whole fortification, as plain as though we
were on the high tower, here&mdash;&rdquo; indicating on the
draft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; she smiled; &ldquo;but to me it
looks only like a lot of black lines, flung down at
random and with varying degrees of force; sort
of an embroidery pattern, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand, bending over the sheet, did not hear
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">[305]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What did you make out of this, Major?&rdquo; he
asked; &ldquo;there seems to be nothing on the key to
explain it&mdash;might it be intended to indicate a
secret passage from the second floor of the keep
to the postern?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That puzzled me also,&rdquo; said Meux, &ldquo;but your
explanation, sir, seems very likely.&mdash;Possibly old
Jessac might know something; he has been here
for more than seventy years, as a boy, and upper
servant, and steward, and now as sort of steward
emeritus and general reminiscer; and he has the
legends and history of this castle at his tongue&rsquo;s
end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Princess, &ldquo;if anyone know,
it&rsquo;s Jessac, and I think he served for a time in
Lotzen Castle&mdash;have him here, Major, if you
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man came, tall, slender, shrivelled of
face, white and thin of hair, yet erect and vigorous,
despite his almost four and a half score years.
They raised men, and kept them long, in the tingling,
snapping, life-giving air of the Voragian
mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kneel, Jessac,&rdquo; the Regent exclaimed,
giving him her hand.</p>
<p>He bent and kissed it with the most intense
devotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My little Princess! my little Princess!&rdquo; he
repeated; &ldquo;God is good to have let old Jessac see
you once more before he dies.&rdquo; Then he straightened,
and, turning sharply toward the Archduke,
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
scanned him with an intentness almost savage.
Suddenly his hand rose in salute. &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re
a man, and a Dalberg, too&mdash;the finest Dalberg
these old eyes ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Armand understood, and went to him, and
took his hand, and held it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one loves her, Jessac,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
none quite as you and I.&rdquo; Then he drew him over
to the table. &ldquo;Do you know the interior of Lotzen
Castle?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I know this one, my lord&mdash;I lived in it for
twenty years in my young days; even now I could
go blindfolded from gate to highest turret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this plan accurate now? See, here is the
gateway, and this is the keep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, sir.&rdquo;&mdash;He studied it for a little
while, following the lines with his finger, and muttering
brokenly to himself, under his breath.
&ldquo;Yes, Your Highness, it&rsquo;s about the same, except
that here is an outer building for servants, and
here a storehouse; and the arrangement of the
rooms in the main part is some different, particularly
on the second floor, where several have been
made out of one; but the stairway and hall are
still as they always were. Indeed, sir, there has
been small change or improvement since long before
the present lord&rsquo;s father died. Duke Ferdinand
had never visited it for more than a score
of years, until a few weeks ago, just a little while
before our gracious master was called&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">[307]</div>
<p>The old man was garrulous; so far, age had not
missed him; and here the Archduke interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jessac,&rdquo; he said kindly, &ldquo;you have made all
that very clear; now can you tell us if there is
any secret passage in the castle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, sir,&rdquo; was the prompt answer; &ldquo;leastwise,
I know one, there may be others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the library to the postern gate, near
the west tower&mdash;this is it, sir,&rdquo; indicating the
line on the plan; &ldquo;many is the time I&rsquo;ve used it,
his lordship being absent, when I wanted to get
out at night; indeed, sir, there is a key to the
postern still here, as well as duplicates to almost
every door. They were not surrendered when
King Henry gave the place to the late Duke&mdash;all
the locks had been changed shortly before that.
Would Your Highness care to see the keys?&mdash;they
are in the armory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring them here,&rdquo; said the Constable quickly....
&ldquo;I know by experience, sir, that if
Jessac get you into the armory, you won&rsquo;t escape
for hours; he has a story for every piece in it, and
wants to tell them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man came back, a dozen large keys
jangling; and laid them on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is to the postern,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s smaller
than the others, so it could be carried more easily,
you know, sir&mdash;these brass tags, sir, show where
they belong.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">[308]</div>
<p>The Archduke looked them over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the key from the library to the
secret passage,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is none, sir; the big stone in the middle
of the side wall of the library, and the one on the
right just inside the postern arch, revolve when
pushed at the upper edge&mdash;this way, Your Highness,&rdquo;
and he demonstrated, using a book as the
stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Jessac,&rdquo; said Armand, with a
smile and a nod of dismissal; &ldquo;we may want you
again to-morrow. I&rsquo;ll keep the keys,&rdquo; and he
swept them into a drawer of the desk.</p>
<p>Then the Constable withdrew, and for a while
Armand and Moore studied the plan, and went over
the problem confronting them; and which, though
greatly simplified now, was still difficult and delicate
beyond anything either had ever been obliged
to solve. Perilous it was, too&mdash;but that neither
regarded for himself; and Moore would gladly
have assumed it alone could he have insured thereby
the Archduke&rsquo;s safety.</p>
<p>Through it all the Princess watched them, harkening
carefully to what was said, and saying a few
things herself, mainly in the shape of questions
which showed that, even if to her the draft did
resemble an embroidery pattern, she was astonishingly
apt at following the discussion. But when
Armand remarked that he would make the attempt
that very night, she interposed promptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">[309]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until to-morrow,&rdquo; she urged; &ldquo;take at
least one night&rsquo;s rest; you need it; and the extra
day may disclose something as to the situation in
Lotzen Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night is the proper time,&rdquo; said the Archduke;
&ldquo;we may not be expected then; we shall be
most assuredly to-morrow; it&rsquo;s our one chance for
a surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with our dear cousin that chance is no
chance, as you are very well aware,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;he
knows you are here, and why you are here, and he
is ready for you this instant. No, no, dear, it&rsquo;s
simply your natural impetuosity, which I came
along to moderate; and here is my first veto: not
to-night.&rdquo; She put her hand on his arm. &ldquo;Please,
Armand, please; don&rsquo;t you understand&mdash;I want
to be sure of you a little longer; the day you enter
Lotzen Castle may be our last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moore turned quickly away&mdash;and the Archduke
looked once into the soft eyes, and at the adorable
smile; and the eyes and the smile conquered, as
eyes and smile always will when the one woman
uses them, as the one woman always can, if she try.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought not to let you persuade me,&rdquo; he said,
with a half serious shake of his hand, &ldquo;but&mdash;you&rsquo;re
pretty hard to resist. At least, you won&rsquo;t
prohibit my riding over toward the Castle, and
having a look at it now, in broad day, if I promise
not to venture inside nor very near.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">[310]</div>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I should like to go with you;
come, we will all go&mdash;you tell the Ambassador,
and I&rsquo;ll get Helen and Elise,&rdquo; with a nod and a
smile at Moore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A reconnaissance in force!&rdquo; the Archduke
laughed, when the Regent had gone; then he ordered
the horses, and he and Moore went off to
get into riding uniform.</p>
<p>A wide, macadamized avenue wound sharply
down from the castle to the valley, where the roads
were of the soil, soft and sandy. Once there, the
six loosed bridle and sped away across the level
country; nor drew rein but thrice until they came
to the forks, where the road to Lotzen took off
for its mile of tortuous ascent.</p>
<p>Here they halted, and Armand and Moore
scanned through their glasses the Castle and its
approach; and by riding a very little way up
toward it, they were able to see the postern gate,
which was on the edge of the hill about a third of
the distance around from the bridge, and was approached
by a narrow, rain-washed, boulder-strewn
path, leading almost straight up the side of the
acclivity. The moat ran only across the front, the
almost sheer descent on the other sides of the wall
having been deemed, even in the old days, quite
sufficient protection against assault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Archduke, as he shoved the
glasses back into their case, &ldquo;thank God, we have
old Jessac to tell us how to find that postern path&mdash;and,
Colonel, before we start, it might be wise
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
for each of us to make his will, and to say good-bye
to his lady, for, of a truth, it is going to be a
rather serious business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rode back by way of Porgia, the garrison
town, five miles down the valley. It was also the
railway station for both Castles, though some
years before, King Frederick had run a track over
as close as possible to Dalberg, so his own train
could always be at hand to hurry him away. And
there it had brought the Regent that morning,
and was now waiting, ready for instant use.</p>
<p>A regiment of Uhlans were at drill on the edge
of the town, and the Princess waved her cocked
hat to them as she cantered by. The Colonel in
command answered with his saber, while from two
thousand lusty throats went up a wild cheer of
passionate devotion.</p>
<p>Armand reached over and patted her on the
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, dear, the soldiers love you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to,&rdquo;&mdash;then out flashed the smile
again; &ldquo;but there is only one I&rsquo;m sure of,&rdquo; leaning
over close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little temptress!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a great
mind to prove it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed merrily. &ldquo;You may&mdash;but catch
me first;&rdquo; and as her horse had the heels of his,
she never let him get quite on even terms, no matter
what the pace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">[312]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come, dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise to wait
until we are at the Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you wish&mdash;but the bend in the road yonder
would have hid the others, and there I was&mdash;but
until the Castle, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when Armand promised double punishment
later, she tossed her head, and told him she was
always ready to pay for her crimes&mdash;and sometimes
rather willing.</p>
<p>As they turned from the valley road into the
avenue, they came face to face with the Duke of
Lotzen and Count Bigler, both in full uniform.</p>
<p>The Princess was passing on, with a curt return
of their salutes, when the Duke drew around in
front of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Royal Highness and myself seem to be
unfortunate in our visits to each other,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;I missed yours the other evening, and now you
have missed mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been to Dalberg Castle?&rdquo; she asked.
He bowed. &ldquo;For my call of ceremony upon
the Regent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reined aside. &ldquo;You are not on the Regent&rsquo;s
list, sir,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;if you wish to save
your dignity, you would best not present yourself
until summoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assumed it was restored by your own informal
visit,&rdquo; he smiled.&mdash;&ldquo;Will you not honor
Lotzen Castle, also?&mdash;and you, too, cousin Armand!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_313">[313]</div>
<p>But neither answered him by so much as a look,
and with a mocking laugh he went on, saluting the
American Ambassador with easy formality, and
bestowing upon Mlle. d&rsquo;Essold&eacute; a leeringly suggestive
smile, that made Moore frantic to strike
him in the face.</p>
<p>The Princess&rsquo; toilet was finished very early that
evening, and then she sent for her Adjutant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Moore,&rdquo; said she, motioning him to
be seated, &ldquo;I am resolved that the Archduke shall
not venture into Lotzen Castle to-morrow night,
and therefore, I am going myself to-night; will
you go with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s amazement deprived him of an immediate
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Your Highness!&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite useless to protest; I&rsquo;m going; if
you do not care to escort me, I shall get
Bernheim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go alone,&rdquo; he urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Archduke, what of him?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Archduke stays here, serenely ignorant
of it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will never forgive me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She cut him short. &ldquo;Very well, monsieur, you
are excused&mdash;be so good as to send Colonel Bernheim
to me at once&mdash;and I trust to your honor
not to mention the affair to any one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_314">[314]</div>
<p>He had done all he dared; more, indeed, than
he had fancied she would tolerate. A subordinate
may not argue for long with the Regent of a Kingdom,
however sweet-tempered she may be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness misunderstands,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;if
you are determined to go, there is an end of the
matter; naturally, your Adjutant goes also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled. &ldquo;Now, that is better&mdash;and I&rsquo;m
glad&mdash;and we will take De Coursey and Marsov,
and slip away at midnight, with old Jessac for
guide. The secret passage opens into the Duke&rsquo;s
library, we get the Book and retire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vault and all?&rdquo; Moore asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember the draft, Colonel, there
isn&rsquo;t a vault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless, however, there is a safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waved her hand impatiently. &ldquo;It will be
time enough for that when we get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we can&rsquo;t find the Book in the library?&rdquo;
he persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will seek it elsewhere&mdash;it&rsquo;s just that
contingency which sends me. If I were sure it is
in the library, I might let the Archduke go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet will you not take some precaution for your
own safety, in event of Lotzen overcoming us?&rdquo;
Moore asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bring myself to believe that he would
venture to harm the Regent, but, if he should,
these,&rdquo; pushing two papers across to him, &ldquo;ought
to be sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_315">[315]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness is a strategist,&rdquo; said the
Colonel, when he had read them. &ldquo;I have nothing
to suggest; and I&rsquo;m ready now to go with a more
willing spirit and a lighter heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held out her hand, and flashed him the smile,
usually reserved for Armand, alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we will save the king, Ralph&mdash;you and
I; and give him the Book, and speed him to his
crowning. I leave the details to you, to see the
others, and instruct and caution them; remember,
for the Archduke to get the slightest suspicion
would ruin everything. It will be for me to see
that he retires early to-night. Now, do you, yourself,
seek out Bernheim and send him to me
quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; said she, acknowledging
Bernheim&rsquo;s stiff military salute with one equally
formal, &ldquo;I need your aid in a matter of peculiar
importance and delicacy&mdash;and which must not,
under any circumstance, be known to any one in
the Castle, and above all not to His Highness the
Archduke&mdash;not a whisper of it, Colonel Bernheim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernheim&rsquo;s answer was another salute, but he
could say as much with it, in an instant, as some
men in an hour of talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are two sealed orders,&rdquo; she continued;
&ldquo;immediately after dinner you will ride down to
Porgia; there, not before, you will open the one
addressed to yourself, and deliver the other to the
Commanding Officer of the garrison. For the rest,
the orders will speak for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_316">[316]</div>
<p>Once more, the martinet&rsquo;s hand went up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Your Highness,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but how am
I to go without getting leave from the Archduke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will get it for you&mdash;you need not say anything
to him&mdash;just go&mdash;&mdash;Ah! there he is now&mdash;Armand,&rdquo;
said she, when he had greeted her, &ldquo;I
want to borrow Colonel Bernheim for a little while
after dinner, may I have him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him,&rdquo; said the Archduke, with a smile
at his Aide; and when Bernheim had gone: &ldquo;but
why don&rsquo;t you borrow me instead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, sweetheart, one doesn&rsquo;t need to borrow
what one has,&rdquo; she answered, and gave him
both her hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_317">[317]</div>
<h2 id="c21">XXI
<br /><span class="small">IN THE DUKE&rsquo;S LIBRARY</span></h2>
<p>The Princess managed so well that by a little
after eleven o&rsquo;clock the card games were over, and
she, laughingly, had escorted Armand to his own
door and received his promise to retire at once.</p>
<p>Then she went to her apartment and dismissed
all the attendants except her maid. To-night she
must ride as a man, so she donned a close-fitting
divided skirt, high boots, and her Blue Guard&rsquo;s
jacket, and topped it with a long military overcoat
that came almost to her spurs.</p>
<p>Colonel Moore met her at a side entrance, and
they hurried across the courtyard and over the
bridge to where, a little way down the avenue,
were waiting De Coursey and Marsov, with Jessac
and the horses. They had thought to send the
old man in a carriage, but he would have none of
it; so they let him have his way, when he assured
them he could ride twice the distance without
fatigue&mdash;and he proved it that night.</p>
<p>In calm persistence of purpose Dehra was a
typical Dalberg; she had determined that the
Archduke should not expose his life in Lotzen&rsquo;s
castle, and so she was assuming the risk, without
the least hesitation; just as the same Dalberg spirit
<span class="pb" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
sent the Archduke to recover the Book, heedless of
the peril entailed. And so now, after a word of
inquiry as to the general arrangements and the
time required to reach the postern gate, she made
no further reference to the business in hand. Instead,
she chatted with Moore as unconcernedly as
though she rode for her pleasure, and not upon a
desperate mission where death was likely waiting
for them all.</p>
<p>There was no moon, but the stars burned with
double brilliancy in the wonderful mountain
heavens; the road lay fair before them; and far
off to the front the lights of Lotzen Castle beckoned.
And as they crossed the valley, the lights
gradually grew fewer, until presently there was but
one remaining, which Jessac said was the big lamp
on the bridge in front of the gate-arch, and which
always burnt until sunrise.</p>
<p>A little way from the Lotzen road they met
Colonel Bernheim, alone. He bent forward in
sharp scrutiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God, Moore, you persuaded her not to
come!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as they drew up.</p>
<p>The Princess&rsquo; light laugh answered him, and he
actually cried out in distressed disappointment,
and forgot the eternal salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t to be persuaded, Colonel,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;Is everything arranged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time the salute came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_319">[319]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The dispositions are made as Your Highness
ordered,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>She thanked him, and he rode beside her to the
cross-roads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must leave you here.&mdash;Heaven keep you
safe this night,&rdquo; he ended, with broken voice.</p>
<p>She reined over close to him and held out her
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good Bernheim, nothing is going to happen
to me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but if there should, it will
be for you and Epping to seat the Archduke where
he belongs, and to confound Lotzen and his satellites&mdash;promise
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Colonel&rsquo;s face twitched, and his eyes glistened,
and for a moment he bowed his head on his
breast; then he leaned over and kissed her
gauntlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As God reigns, it shall be done, my mistress,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;and though I have to kill Lotzen with
my own hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of taking the road to the Castle they
continued up the valley a little way, to where a
narrow brook tumbled noisily across the track,
eager to reach the foaming Dreer. Here Jessac
dismounted, and, leading his horse, turned upstream.
There was no path, and the starlight
availed nothing in the heavy timber, yet the old
man never hesitated, winding his way among the
trees and around the rocks as readily as though it
were day. After half a mile, the ground began
to ascend sharply; almost immediately he halted,
and at his direction they turned the horses over
to the orderlies, and followed him on foot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_320">[320]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The postern path, such as it is, is yonder,&rdquo;
he said, and a few steps brought them to it, just
where it ended its plunge down the bald side of
the hill from the Castle that now towered almost
straight above them, a mass of black forbiddingness
respouss&eacute;d against the sky-line by the reflection
of the gate-way lamp.</p>
<p>Colonel Moore made a last appeal to the Princess
to abandon her purpose to accompany them,
and was good-naturedly overruled, and peremptorily
ordered to lead on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you have a Dalberg retire with the
enemy in sight?&rdquo; she ended.</p>
<p>The postern path was now no path&mdash;only a
narrow, water-washed gully; yet, even so, it was the
only means of access to the summit from that
side,&mdash;or indeed, from any side save in front&mdash;elsewhere
the tangle of brambles and the rocks,
with the almost perpendicular elevation, made
ascent practically impossible by daylight, and absolutely
impossible by night. In fact, this way
had long been abandoned, and the present course
lay close under the wall, and over the moat by a
narrow foot bridge, and then along it to the road
just below the main gate. Jessac had not ventured
to use it, however, because it was exposed to
the light of the lamp, and so was in full view of
the porter on duty in the tower.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_321">[321]</div>
<p>It was rough climbing, and half way up Moore
called a halt, to give the Princess a short rest;
then they went on, stumbling, slipping, scrambling,
trying to go quietly, and yet, it seemed,
making noise sufficient to wake every one in Lotzen
Castle.</p>
<p>But at last they reached the top, and the Princess
leaned against the wall, breathless and trembling
from the unaccustomed exertion.</p>
<p>Moore raised his hand for silence. In the intense
calm of the night, the lightest noise would have
echoed trebly loud, yet the only sound they heard
was the splashing of the Dreer among its rocks,
in the fog strewn valley far below. He drew out
his watch, and after much looking made out the
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s after one o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;when
Your Highness is ready&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready now,&rdquo; said she, and turned at once
to the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet, man, quiet!&rdquo; Moore cautioned, as
Jessac&rsquo;s key scraped into the lock, and suddenly
turned it with a loud snap. The old man pushed
the door back slowly; the arch was twenty feet
through, and the darkness impenetrable; but he
entered unhesitatingly, and the others with him,
Moore&rsquo;s hand on the Regent&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_322">[322]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can you find the stone without a light?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easily, sir! ... here it is&mdash;stand
back, my lord, or it may hit you ...
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a slight creak, and Moore was sensible
of something swinging up by his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s open, sir,&rdquo; said Jessac; &ldquo;but best not
show a light until we are inside, it might be seen
in the courtyard&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go in first&mdash;bend low or
you&rsquo;ll strike your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Adjutant took Dehra&rsquo;s hand and having
located the stone and the opening, he guided her
through. Jessac closed the stone into place and
then, by the light of Moore&rsquo;s electric torch, he
showed them how it was so balanced that by pressure
at the top (from without) or at the bottom
(from within) it would swing around parallel with
the floor.</p>
<p>The passage was large enough for two of them
to walk abreast and without stooping, and extended
through the heart of the wall, about a
hundred feet, until opposite the keep, as Jessac
informed them; here it narrowed to half, and by
a dozen stone steps descended below the level of
the bailey, and thence under it to another set of
steps leading up inside the wall of the keep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_323">[323]</div>
<p>Thus far they had come rapidly and without incident.
Suddenly a drove of rats, blinded by the
light and squeaking in terror, ran among their
feet, and the Princess instinctively caught up the
skirts of her long coat, and, with a little shriek
of fright, tried to climb up the side of the passage.</p>
<p>The cry, slight as it was, let loose all the echoes
of the vault with appalling resonance; instantly
Moore extinguished the torch and laid his hand on
her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fool I am!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a whisper;
&ldquo;now, I&rsquo;ve spoiled everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not likely,&rdquo; he assured her; &ldquo;the castle is
asleep and the walls are thick, but we best wait
a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently the rats commenced to squeak again,
and to scurry about, and the Princess beginning
to tremble, he switched on the torch and motioned
Jessac to proceed.</p>
<p>Treading as lightly as one of his own mountain
cats, the old fellow went swiftly up the stairs,
and when the others reached the top he was not
to be seen. Moore shot the light down the passage;
thirty feet away, if the draft were correct, were
the stairs that ended at the library; when they
reached them, Jessac was on the landing signaling
to come on.</p>
<p>He drew the Colonel over to the big stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There used to be a crack along the edge
here,&rdquo; he said, very low, &ldquo;where I could listen, and
also see a very little, but it seems to have been
closed. Shall I swing the stone, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_324">[324]</div>
<p>Moore hesitated. What lay behind the stone?
His last look at the library windows, from far
down the hillside, had shown no light within; yet
was it really so, or was it only that the curtains
were drawn? If the Princess would but consent
to remain here, at least until he had gone in and
inspected. He glanced at her uncertainly, and
she read his mind, and shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I follow <i>you</i>,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>With a sigh, he adjusted his mask; she and
De Coursey and Marsov did the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the stone move easily?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did when I used it, sir,&rdquo; said Jessac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you open it only a trifle at first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lord, once started it must make its
swing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if there be something in the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There never used to be, sir; it was always
kept clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then pray Heaven it is so still.&rdquo; He loosed
his sword and shut off the torch. &ldquo;Open!&rdquo; he
ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to hold, sir,&rdquo; said Jessac presently;
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t move it&mdash;may I have the light a moment?...
Now, I&rsquo;ll try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They heard him pushing; gently, then harder,
finally with all his strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it, my lord,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s either
out of balance or has been closed on the inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess gave an exclamation of alarm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_325">[325]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said she impatiently, &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be
opened?&mdash;we have failed? impossible, it must be
opened&mdash;try again, Jessac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be it&rsquo;s only jammed,&rdquo; said Moore;
&ldquo;come, I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But still the stone refused to stir&mdash;suddenly it
moved a very little&mdash;caught&mdash;moved a little more&mdash;caught
again&mdash;then wrenched itself free, with
a grinding scrape, and swung slowly around.</p>
<p>They heard it collide with something; the next
moment came a terrific crash of shattering glass,
and the resounding clatter of a metal tray.</p>
<p>Moore ground back an oath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close the stone!&rdquo; said he instantly, &ldquo;quick,
man, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But though it seemed to take an eternity to
shut down, there was not the slightest sound, or
other indication that any one had been aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; he asked the Princess;
&ldquo;that din must have been heard; shall we wait
and risk another try, or escape now by the postern
before we could be cut off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will risk another try,&rdquo; said she, at once.
&ldquo;Give the word whenever you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For himself he was well content; his fighting
blood was up, and here might be his opportunity
to have it out with Lotzen, so he settled back to
wait, harkening for the sound of any one coming
by the passage; the location of the broken
glass would tell the Duke instantly the cause, and
his first act, naturally, would be to send a party
<span class="pb" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
around to intercept them; though, being a stranger
in his own castle, he might not know of the secret
way, in which case the accident would have no
materially adverse result save, possibly, to startle
those within hearing from a sound sleep.</p>
<p>And while they delayed, Moore gossiped in
whispers with the Regent, hoping to divert her,
if only a very little, from the heavy strain she must
be under&mdash;the blackness was enough, in itself, for
a woman to endure, without the danger. And
he marvelled at her calmness and ease, and the
light laugh which came at times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good of you, Colonel,&rdquo; said she finally,
&ldquo;but I think I&rsquo;m past fearing now. I was horribly
afraid at first, and the rats almost made me
faint with terror, but now I&rsquo;m sort of dazed,
dreaming, automatic, whatever it is&mdash;when the reaction
comes, there likely will be hysterics&mdash;but
that shan&rsquo;t be until all this is ended&mdash;it&rsquo;s this
inaction that is the most trying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moore touched Jessac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have we been waiting?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well on to half an hour, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then swing the stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time it moved instantly and noiselessly.
Moore put his head through the opening and listened;...
save for the ticking of a clock,
somewhere across the room, there was perfect
quiet.... Suddenly it chimed twice;
when the last reverberation had died, he stepped
carefully inside; the Princess and the others
followed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_327">[327]</div>
<p>The library was as dark as the passage; with
a touch of warning to the Regent, Moore pressed
the torch and flashed the stream of white light
around the walls&mdash;fortune favored them; the room
was unoccupied, and every door was closed. Then
the light struck the iron safe, and the Princess,
with the faintest exclamation of apprehension,
grasped her Adjutant&rsquo;s arm and pointed at it.
If the Book were in it, their visit would be barren;
there was neither opportunity nor means to break
inside. For the first time, the idea of failure
touched her&mdash;she had been so full of assurance, so
confident that once in the Duke&rsquo;s library and success
was certain. Even when Moore suggested a
safe she had waved it aside heedlessly. Her mind
had been centered on the desk&mdash;that the Book must
surely be in it. The light reached the big, flat-topped
one in the middle of the room; with a quick
spring she was at it, and Moore beside her.</p>
<p>Swiftly they went through the drawers&mdash;nothing
... nothing ... nothing
... ah! a bundle in black cloth&mdash;she tossed
it out and fairly tore loose the strings&mdash;a glance
was enough&mdash;leather&mdash;metal hinges&mdash;the Book! the
Book! at last!</p>
<p>In an agony of delight she flung the cloth
around it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&mdash;come!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_328">[328]</div>
<p>A shrill whistle&mdash;the doors were thrown open
wide; in bounded three men, a lighted candelabra
in each hand, and behind them a dozen more with
rifles leveled. At the same moment, the Duke
himself stepped from behind a curtain, and closed
the stone into place.</p>
<p>At the whistle, De Coursey, Marsov and old
Jessac had sprung to Dehra&rsquo;s side and, with
Moore, ranged themselves around her&mdash;and now
they stood there, five masked figures, swords
drawn, the center of a circle of impending death,
every man ready to fling himself upon the guns
and chance it, but restrained because of her they
were sworn to guard.</p>
<div class="img">

<p class="center"><small>AT THE WHISTLE, DE COURSEY, MARSOV AND OLD JESSAC HAD SPRUNG TO DEHRA&rsquo;S SIDE.</small></p>
</div>
<p>The Duke gave a chuckling laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Altogether a very striking picture,&rdquo; he remarked,
with a wave of his hand around the room;
&ldquo;the candles&mdash;the masks&mdash;the swords&mdash;the guns&mdash;the
attitudes;&mdash;it is a pity, Cousin Armand,
you cannot see it as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks I am the Archduke,&rdquo; Moore whispered
to the Regent; &ldquo;let him think it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your coming to-night was a surprise,&rdquo; the
Duke was saying, &ldquo;I admit it&mdash;I had not expected
you before to-morrow at the earliest&mdash;my compliments
on your expeditiousness.&rdquo; He drew out a
cigarette and lighted it at one of the candles&mdash;then
flung the box over on the desk; &ldquo;help yourselves,
messieurs, <i>la derni&egrave;re cigarette</i>,&rdquo; he laughed
with sneering malevolence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_329">[329]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep perfectly still,&rdquo; Moore cautioned, very
low. &ldquo;If it come to the worst, I&rsquo;ll try to kill
him first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you address me, cousin?&rdquo; Lotzen asked;
&ldquo;a little louder, please&mdash;and keep your hand outside
your coat; the first of you who tries for his
revolver will precipitate a massacre&mdash;even poor
marksmen can&rsquo;t well miss at such a distance, and
on the whole, these fellows are rather skilful.&rdquo;
He smoked a bit in silence, tapping the splintered
glass on the floor with the point of his sword.
&ldquo;Behold, cousin, my preservers&mdash;a decanter and
some slender Venetian goblets; queer things,
surely, to decide the fate of a Kingdom. But for
their fall, you would have won. Now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he
glanced significantly toward the ready rifles.
&ldquo;Yet, on the whole, I wish you had waited until
another night&mdash;it could have been done elsewhere
so much more neatly&mdash;before you got here&mdash;or
saw that, the package in the black cloth. You
came upon me so suddenly, I had time only to
take you&mdash;and now that I have you, frankly,
cousin, I&rsquo;m at a loss how to dispose of you&mdash;and
your good friends.... Come, I&rsquo;ll be
generous; choose your own way, make it as easy
as you like&mdash;only, <i>make it</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slight stir caused him to turn. Madeline
Spencer, in a shimmering white neglig&eacute;e, was
standing in the doorway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_330">[330]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear, come here,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;this is
altogether the best point of view for the picture:
&lsquo;The End of the Game&rsquo; is its title&mdash;is it not,
cousin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this woman&rsquo;s life there had been many scenes,
strange, bizarre, fantastic, yet never one so fiercely
fateful as was this. And for once she was frightened&mdash;the
flickering candelabra held aloft&mdash;the
leveled guns&mdash;the masked group around the desk&mdash;the
lone man leaning nonchalantly on a chair,
smiling, idly indifferent, as much the master of
it all as a painter, brush poised before his canvas,
able to smear it out at a single stroke.</p>
<p>He held out his hand to her. She shook her
head, meaning to go away; yet lingering, fascinated
and intense. Armand Dalberg was yonder&mdash;on
the brink of the grave, she knew. Once she had
loved him&mdash;still loved him, may be&mdash;but assuredly
not as she loved herself, and the power of wealth
and place. Nor could she save him even if she try;
so much she knew beyond a question, so, why try.</p>
<p>The Duke faced his prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, cousin mine, what shall it be: swords,
bullets, poison? Time passes. You have disturbed
me at an unseemly hour, and I must to sleep
again.... No answer, cousin? Truly,
you have changed; once your tongue was free
enough; and it&rsquo;s not from fright, I&rsquo;m sure; that,
I will grant&mdash;you&rsquo;re no more afraid than am I
myself. However, if you won&rsquo;t choose, I&rsquo;ll have
to do it for you.... You came by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
secret passage, and by it shall you return&mdash;part
way&mdash;bound, but not gagged, it won&rsquo;t be necessary;
please appreciate my leniency. Then, while you are
lying quietly there, the revolving stones shall be
sealed so tight that mortal man can never find
them. Is it not a fine plan, cousin, to have been
devised so quickly; and are you not proud of the
mausoleum that you, a poor, unknown American,
will have: the titular castle of Valeria&rsquo;s new
King?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first, the Princess had been cold with terror&mdash;the
muzzles of loaded rifles at ten paces, are
not for women&rsquo;s nerves; but as the Duke talked
she grew calmer, and the fear subsided, and anger
came instead. And even as he seemed to take a
devilish pleasure in grilling his victims with rage-provoking
words, so she let him run along, to dig
his own grave the deeper.</p>
<p>Now she stepped out from the group, and
dropped her mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which cousin do you think you have been
addressing, my lord of Lotzen?&rdquo; she asked, taking
off her hat.</p>
<p>The commotion in the room was instant; but
the Duke stayed it with an angry gesture. His
men were foreigners, and free of any sentiment
beyond the sheen of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you little fool,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;you have
dared to come here, too! Do you fancy that even
you can save your upstart lover?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_332">[332]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean His Royal Highness the Archduke
Armand,&rdquo; said she, very quietly, &ldquo;he needs
no saving&mdash;he is not here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was but one person in all the world whose
word Ferdinand of Lotzen would accept as truth:
he knew the Princess Dehra never lied. And now
he sprang up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;not here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to her companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messieurs, will you do me the courtesy to
unmask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke ran his eyes over the four, and
shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, messieurs,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I shall not
forget you, believe me I shall not.&mdash;But where,
cousin, is His Royal Highness the Archduke Armand?&rdquo;
(sneering out every word of the title).
&ldquo;Did you lose him on the way?&mdash;or is he skulking
in the passage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dehra laughed scornfully. &ldquo;You change front
quickly; a moment since you doubted his courage
no more than your own. This is my own adventure;
neither the Archduke, nor any one else in
Dalberg Castle, is aware of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lotzen bowed. &ldquo;My thanks, cousin, for that
last bit of news&mdash;I know the better, now, how to
dispose of you and your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess walked over and sat on the corner
of the desk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_333">[333]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to understand, my lord, that you would
attempt to restrain me and my escort from leaving
this castle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who enter a residence with criminal intent,
and are apprehended in the act, can hardly
expect to escape unscathed. You have overlooked
the fact, doubtless, that the privilege of high justice
still attaches to this domain, though long since
unexerted. Just what that justice will be I have
not decided&mdash;enough, at present, that you are
prisoners awaiting sentence, and since none will
ever seek you here, I can let events determine when
and where it will be pronounced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Dehra understood just what was in his
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is another way of saying, cousin, that
when you have killed the Archduke or made him
prisoner, it will be time enough to pass judgment
on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke gave his chuckling laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness has the wisdom of a sage,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;and I advise you to employ it during
your sojourn here, in ascertaining just what attitude
is likely to be the best for yourself, after
the American has been&mdash;eliminated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now the anger, which had been burning
hotter and hotter, burst into flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you fancy, Ferdinand of Lotzen,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
striking a chair with the flat of her sword,
&ldquo;that I would venture into this den without first
having made ample provision for our safe return?
<span class="pb" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
Around this place, at this moment, stretches a
cordon of three thousand soldiers with orders to
let no one pass the lines, and if by sunrise I have
not returned, to take this Castle by assault and
show no quarter. Colonel Bernheim is in command.
I fancy you will admit that he will execute
the orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Lotzen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you doubt as to the troops, you can
send and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will admit the troops also, cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess put the cloth-wrapped book under
her arm and stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if you will clear the doorway, we will
depart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, my dear,&rdquo; he smiled; &ldquo;you seem
to have missed the fact that a written command
is quite as effective as an oral one; therefore, you
will oblige me by taking of the paper and ink on
the desk beside you, and inditing to Colonel Bernheim
an order to withdraw instantly all the troops
to Porgia, and himself to join you here&mdash;but first,
you will favor me by returning that bundle to
the drawer where you got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess glanced uncertainly at Moore,
hesitated, then handed the bundle to him, and turning
to the desk wrote rapidly for a few minutes&mdash;read
over the sheet, and held it out to the Duke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_335">[335]</div>
<p>He took it with a bow, and went back to his
place.... The order was clear and unequivocal,
almost in his own words, indeed. Her
ready acquiescence had amazed him&mdash;now doubt
came, and then suspicion&mdash;was he being outwitted?
Had she provided for just such a contingency?
He read the order again&mdash;then put it in its envelope
and went toward the corridor door. He
would have to chance it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, cousin,&rdquo; said the Princess; &ldquo;you
may as well know that the only effect of that order,
or any other, save from my own lips, will be to
bring the assault forthwith, instead of at sunrise.
It&rsquo;s for you to choose which it shall be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and regarded her contemplatively;
and she spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the profit now in restraining us? You
have been playing for a Crown&mdash;you have lost;&rdquo;
(pointing to the book) &ldquo;but why lose your life,
too&mdash;though, frankly, as to that, save for the
nasty scandal, I have no concern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face hardened. &ldquo;There could be a few lives
lost here before sunrise,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>She smiled indifferently, though her heart beat
faster at the threat; she had risked everything on
her firm conviction that his cool, calculating brain
would never be run away with by anger nor revenge&mdash;and
the test was now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly, my dear Ferdinand,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;you can have us killed&mdash;and then the sunrise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he stared at her unrelentingly, and fear began
to crowd upon her fast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_336">[336]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have we lost?&rdquo; she said very low to Moore.
&ldquo;Have I brought you all to death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends on the next minute,&rdquo; he replied;
&ldquo;if we live through it we&rsquo;re safe. He will have
quit seeing red then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Madeline Spencer saw that he was hesitating;
swiftly she went to him, and taking his
hand, spoke to him softly and with insistent
earnestness.</p>
<p>Gradually the frown faded; the fell look passed;
at last, he smiled at her and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We win,&rdquo; said Moore.</p>
<p>The Duke turned toward the corridor door and
gave an order; the men drew aside into line, rifles
at the present. Then he bowed low to the
Princess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since I know I may not do the honor myself,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I pray you will accept my Constable as
my substitute.&mdash;Captain Durant, escort Her Royal
Highness the Regent to the main gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durant stepped forward and his blade flashed
in salute. Dehra acknowledged it with her own,
then snapped it back into its sheath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead on, sir!&rdquo; she said very graciously, and
gave him her hand.</p>
<p>Without so much as a glance at the Duke, she
passed from the room; and on the other side of
her went Colonel Moore, sword in one hand, the
cloth-wrapped book in the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_337">[337]</div>
<p>When they had gone, Lotzen dismissed every
one with a nod, and sitting down drew Madeline
Spencer on his knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my good angel,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you came
at the psychological moment; another instant and
I would have sent them all to the devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slipped her arm around his neck, and kissed
him lightly on the cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then the sunrise,&rdquo; she whispered, with a
shudder.</p>
<p>He caught her to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And even Paris is better than that, my
duchess!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;Paris or anywhere, with you.&rdquo;...
Presently he laughed. &ldquo;I should like
to see Dehra&rsquo;s face when she opens that book,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Madeline Spencer sprang up, pointing to the
clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are wasting time,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you see that we must go to Dornlitz this very night&mdash;that,
now, to-morrow will be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; he said; and, with wrinkled
brow and half-closed eyes, sat, thinking&mdash;then:
&ldquo;We may not use a special train, for we must go
disguised; but the express for the South passes
Porgia at four o&rsquo;clock; we will take it; if it&rsquo;s on
time we shall be in Dornlitz at seven in the evening,
which will allow us an hour to get to the Summer
Palace&mdash;after eight o&rsquo;clock not even I would be
admitted, in the absence of the Regent. Should we
be delayed, as is very likely, we can go out early the
<span class="pb" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
following morning. The American won&rsquo;t know
we left here, and will not be in any state to return&mdash;and
even if he is, it&rsquo;s not probable he will leave
before late to-morrow night, which will bring him
to the Capital about noon&mdash;long after we have
been in the library and got the Book.&rdquo; He strode
to the door and shouted into the corridor for Durant....
&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have the
fastest pair and strongest carriage before the door
at once. Madame and I are off instantly for the
Capital; but see that no one in the Castle knows
it; close the gates, and let none depart. In half
an hour, send four of your trustiest men to cut
the telephone line, in various places, between
Porgia and Dalberg Castle; keep it cut all day,
and prevent, in every way possible, any messages
reaching the Castle. If the Regent, or the American
Archduke, leave by train before to-morrow
night, wire me immediately. Do you understand?&mdash;then
away.... Come along, Duchess,
only ten minutes to dress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a laugh he swung her up in his arms and
bore her to the doorway, snatched a kiss, and left
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_339">[339]</div>
<h2 id="c22">XXII
<br /><span class="small">THE BOOK IN THE CLOTH</span></h2>
<p>As is usually the case when a man retires before
his accustomed hour, the Archduke&rsquo;s slumber was
capricious and broken, finally ending in complete
wakefulness and an intense mental activity that
defied sleep. At length he switched on the reading
lamp beside his bed and looked at his watch. It
was only three o&rsquo;clock. With an exclamation of
disgust he got up and dressed, and went down to
the library. The draft of Lotzen Castle was not
as distinct in his mind as it should be; he would
have another careful look at it and then, alone on
the ramparts, with plenty of room to walk and
think, he would work out the plan of campaign for
the morrow.</p>
<p>He had put the plan and Jessac&rsquo;s keys together
in the desk, the top drawer on the right.&mdash;They
were not there&mdash;nor in the next one&mdash;nor the next&mdash;nor
the next&mdash;they were not in any of them.
He searched again, and carefully ...
they were gone. He went to the far corner where
Major Meux had got the portfolio; its place was
empty. He frowned in puzzled irritation; who
would have presumed to meddle with them?
Moore, possibly, to study the draft, but he would
not have taken the keys; they would be wanted
only when&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_340">[340]</div>
<p>&ldquo;God! might it be!&rdquo; he cried aloud, &ldquo;might it
be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mind flashed back through the day: Dehra&rsquo;s
solicitude that he should not go to-night&mdash;borrow
Bernheim&mdash;early to bed&mdash;a dozen other trifles now
most indicative. With a curse at his stupidity,
he ran to Moore&rsquo;s quarters&mdash;empty&mdash;the bed untouched;
then to Bernheim&rsquo;s&mdash;the same there; to
De Coursey&rsquo;s&mdash;to Marsov&rsquo;s&mdash;both the same. He
burst unannounced into the ante-chamber of the
Princess&rsquo; apartments, bringing a shriek from each
of the sleepy maids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mistress&mdash;is she here?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her Highness retired hours ago, sir,&rdquo; one
of them replied tremblingly, fright still upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is she there now?&mdash;Send Marie here instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The French girl came, wrapped in a long
chamber robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your mistress asleep?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur le Prince, hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached over and flung back her robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why are you still dressed and waiting
up for her? Don&rsquo;t lie to me, girl; where is Her
Highness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur doubts me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke made an angry gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to her&mdash;say I must speak with her at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake the Regent! I dare not, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pushed her aside and went on into the next
room. She sprang after, and caught his hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_341">[341]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you would not!&mdash;you
would not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seized her by the arm. &ldquo;You little fool!
the truth&mdash;the truth&mdash;if your mistress isn&rsquo;t here,
she is in awful peril&mdash;may be dead.&rdquo; He shook her
almost fiercely. &ldquo;The truth, I say, the truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a cry the girl sank to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peril!&mdash;death!&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;She but went
for a ride, sir; I do not understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke was gone; he required no further
information.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, with thirty of the
garrison at his back&mdash;all that could be provided
with horses&mdash;he set out for Lotzen Castle; leaving
it for Courtney, whose official position denied him
the privilege of going along, to telephone the Commandant
at Porgia for troops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went to save me, Dick,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;now I
will save her or&mdash;&mdash;good-bye,&rdquo; and the two men
had gripped hands hard, then the Archduke rode
away.</p>
<p>At first, his anger had been hot against Moore
and Bernheim, but now that sober second thought
was come, he knew that they were not to blame,
that the Regent herself had ordered them to the
service and to silence. And presently his hope
rose at the thought of the one&rsquo;s skilful sword and
sure revolver, and the other&rsquo;s steady head and
calm discretion; together, with De Coursey and
Marsov, there might be a chance that the Princess
<span class="pb" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
would come out alive. But the hope grew suddenly
very slender, as he reached the valley road
and saw the great light of Lotzen Castle shining
far away, and remembered his own sensations as
he had stood under it that afternoon, and who its
master was and what.</p>
<p>They had been obliged to go slowly down the
steep and winding avenue, now he swung into a
gallop and the six score hoofs went thundering
through the valley, leaving the startled inhabitants
staring, and wondering at the strange doings of
all who came from the South. But them the Archduke
never saw&mdash;nor anything, indeed, save the
track before him and the light ahead, riding with
hands low on the saddle, face set and stern; implacable
and relentless as the first Dalberg himself,
the day he rescued his lady from that same
Castle of Lotzen and hung its Baron in quarters
from the gate tower.</p>
<p>Only once did the Archduke pause; at the Dreer,
a moment to breathe the horses and let them wet
their throats. In the darkness he did not see a
bunch of horsemen round the turn in front and
trot slowly toward him, nor could he hear them
for the thrashing of his own horses in the water.
The first he knew of them was Colonel Moore&rsquo;s
peremptory hail:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What force is that yonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a shout that rang far into the night, Armand
sent his mare bounding through the stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_343">[343]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Princess? the Princess?&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;is
she safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And her own voice answered, joyful and
triumphant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, Armand, I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What need to tell what he said, as reining in
close he drew her over to him! The words were a
bit incoherent, may be, but Dehra understood; and
presently she put her arms around his neck and
kissed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Sire,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let us go on&mdash;and
when we get to the Castle, Your Majesty shall
have again the Book of Laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Book! you cannot mean you&rsquo;ve been in
Lotzen Castle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed her merry little laugh. &ldquo;And out
again&mdash;and the Book with us, from under our
dear cousin&rsquo;s very eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brave girl!&mdash;you foolish child!&mdash;you
wonder among women!&rdquo; he marvelled.</p>
<p>She put out her hand, and took his; and so they
rode, back through the valley and up the avenue
to the Castle, and as they went she told him the
story of the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But better than the Book, sweetheart,&rdquo; she
ended, as they drew up before the entrance, &ldquo;it
saves you for Valeria and for me; had you been
there, helpless under his guns, not all the troops
in the Kingdom would have held Lotzen&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And better than all else,&rdquo; he said, as he swung
her down, &ldquo;is your own dear self.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_344">[344]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m but a woman&mdash;you
are the Dalberg and a King....
Colonel Moore, bring your package to the library,
and summon all our friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had come, the Princess took the bundle,
still wrapped in its black cloth, and handed it
to Armand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the Laws of the Dalbergs&mdash;found
this night in Lotzen Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word he bent and kissed her hand,&mdash;then,
laying the package on the desk, he cut the
strings and removed the cloth, exposing the big,
leather-covered, brass-bound volume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read the decree, Sire!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>He opened the book&mdash;stopped&mdash;turned a page&mdash;then
slowly closed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we wait, Your Highness, until the
Royal Council is present,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But something in his voice alarmed her&mdash;she
sprang forward, pushed aside his restraining
arm, and seized the book. One glance inside&mdash;an
exclamation of bewildered incredulity; another
glance&mdash;and the book dropped to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;False!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;false!&rdquo; and flung herself
across the desk in an hysteria of tears.</p>
<p>Instantly Courtney turned and quitted the room,
and the rest after him, leaving her and the Archduke
alone together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_345">[345]</div>
<p>It was evening when the Princess appeared
again. She came just as the clock was striking
nine, and taking the American Ambassador&rsquo;s arm,
led the way in to dinner, which here was <i>en famille</i>,
and without any ceremony of the Court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Mr. Courtney, that I don&rsquo;t look quite
so foolish as I feel,&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>He let his eyes linger on her&mdash;this lovely woman
who was a nation&rsquo;s toast&mdash;the imperially poised
head, with the glorious, gleaming hair, and the
haughty, high-bred face that, when she willed,
could be so sweet and tender; the slender, rounded
figure in its soft white gown of clinging silk&mdash;he
shook his gray head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you feel as you look,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;you
are not of this world, but of Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&mdash;&mdash;h, monsieur! and Lady Helen just
across the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fingered his imperial a moment, then leaned
close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helen is an angel, too,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;?&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>He smiled. &ldquo;Yes, I mean&mdash;on our ride this
afternoon&mdash;but don&rsquo;t tell it, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took his hand low under the board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;Helen&rsquo;s a dear&mdash;and
so are you.&rdquo; Then she gave a little laugh.
&ldquo;This seems to have been a rather busy afternoon
for Cupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another?&mdash;Mlle. d&rsquo;Essold&eacute; and Moore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded. &ldquo;Yes, but not a word of it, either&mdash;not
even to Helen,&rdquo; quizzically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_346">[346]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, not even to Helen,&rdquo; he said with well
affected gravity, his lips twitching the while.</p>
<p>A footman entered and passed a note to Colonel
Bernheim, but the Princess&rsquo; eyes had caught the
pink of the envelope and she knew it was a wire,
and of exceeding importance to be brought there
now&mdash;and it was for the Archduke; if it were for
her, Moore would have got it. Chatting gayly
with Courtney, she yet watched Bernheim, as he
read the message, holding it down, out of sight.</p>
<p>It seemed to be very brief, for almost instantly
he glanced at the Archduke&mdash;hesitated&mdash;then sent
it to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Armand?&rdquo; she said, as he took it.
&ldquo;What has Lotzen done now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Lotzen?&rdquo; he laughed, spreading the
sheet on the cloth before them.</p>
<p>It was dated Dornlitz:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Duke arrived here at eight-thirty this evening
on the express from the North. He was in disguise.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Epping</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the trouble
with our cousin, he is always doing queer
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was at Lotzen Castle this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is in Dornlitz now;&mdash;&rdquo; he shoved the
wire across to Courtney.&mdash;&ldquo;Dick, what do you
make of this&mdash;what&rsquo;s doing now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_347">[347]</div>
<p>Courtney read it, then stared thoughtfully into
his wine glass, twirling it slowly the while, the
amber bubbles streaming upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make enough of it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to urge that
you hurry back to the Capital. The false Book
was intended primarily to lure you here, where
you could be killed more easily, but its purpose
also was to get you away from Dornlitz. The first
failed, because Her Highness forced Lotzen&rsquo;s hand
so quickly he was unprepared; the second, however,
has won,&mdash;he has eluded you. I have always insisted
that he hasn&rsquo;t the Book, but now I am persuaded
that he knows where it is, and has gone for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go, Armand!&rdquo; the Princess exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;let
us go instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put his hand on her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will go, dear,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;see&mdash;&rdquo; and
turning over the sheet, he wrote:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Epping</span>,</p>
<p class="t2">&ldquo;Dornlitz.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Keep him under surveillance. We leave to-night;
reach Dornlitz by ten A. M.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Armand</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Princess, &ldquo;and add that he is
to call the Royal Council for half after ten at the
Summer Palace.&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to give Lotzen a
chance to explain a few things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_348">[348]</div>
<h2 id="c23">XXIII
<br /><span class="small">THE CANOPY OF SWORDS</span></h2>
<p>When the train had crossed the Lorg and the
towers of Dornlitz shone far off to the front, the
following morning, the Princess sent for the
Archduke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Armand,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have been thinking&mdash;much
of the night, indeed&mdash;and I am persuaded
that this day will see the end of our quest; don&rsquo;t
smile; wait, wait until the day has passed. Lotzen
knows where the Book is&mdash;he hasn&rsquo;t it&mdash;he never
has had it&mdash;he would not have needed a counterfeit
if he had; besides, do you fancy he would have
left it behind when he went to Lotzenia&mdash;or that he
would have come back here if he had it with him?
If he knows now where the Book is, he has known
all along&mdash;then why hasn&rsquo;t he got it? Because
it&rsquo;s been impracticable, no adequate opportunity.
Where is the opportunity now that he hasn&rsquo;t had
before?&mdash;the Summer Palace&mdash;with the Household
gone, he can spend a day in it without explanation
or interruption&mdash;and the King&rsquo;s suite is vacant.
There Adolph hid the Laws&mdash;and Lotzen knows
where&mdash;and they are what he has gone for; that
is why he left his Castle night before last, within
an hour after me; he realized the false book would
<span class="pb" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
send us back to Dornlitz and that he must go instantly
if he would be there first. Oh, it&rsquo;s all plain
now&mdash;to me at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke went over and stood beside her,
stroking her fair hair softly with his finger tips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is much force in
what you say, and you will also remember that
Elise d&rsquo;Essold&eacute; saw Lotzen come from the library
the day you charged him with killing Adolph and
stealing the Book. Yet the answer to it all is,
that the entire Palace has been searched and vainly&mdash;and
the King&rsquo;s suite torn almost into bits.
Hence, under the facts, your theory seems
unavailing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at him with a half disappointed
smile, but with an insistent shake of the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go too far with your facts, dear,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;I, too, thought that every inch of the
King&rsquo;s suite had been searched, but I&rsquo;ve changed
my mind; it hasn&rsquo;t been&mdash;if it had, we would
have found the Laws.&rdquo;&mdash;She gave a cry and
sprang up. &ldquo;The box, Armand! the box! the
Book&rsquo;s in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The box was empty,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;<i>was! was!</i> but is not now! When did
you look in it last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Council.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_350">[350]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly&mdash;so did I&mdash;and Adolph brought it
to us, lid down and &lsquo;locked,&rsquo; she said. Oh, I see
it all now:&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t locked, and he put the Book
back in it, and told Lotzen, and Lotzen killed
him&mdash;and then, when he came for the Book, he
found the combination changed&mdash;you did it, you
know&mdash;and as long as Moore was in the suite he
could not break the vault; so he lures us all away:
if he can kill you, he will be King and can get
the Book at his leisure; if he fail, as he has done,
then it&rsquo;s the Laws before we return.&rdquo; She flung
her arms around his neck. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me I&rsquo;m
mistaken, Armand! don&rsquo;t tell me I&rsquo;m mistaken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held her off, and looked at her in wondering
admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh woman!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;oh faith, and intuition,
and loyalty beyond the stars! No, Dehra, I will
not say you are mistaken; I do not know; we will
test it. We will go straight to the Palace&mdash;you
and I, without a word as to our purpose&mdash;and
we will open the vault, and the box&mdash;and if the
Laws are in it, yours be the glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yours the Crown!&rdquo; she cried, and kissed
his hand.</p>
<p>Then the train ran into the station and stopped,
and the Archduke stepped out and gave his hand
to the Princess. The platform was empty save
for Count Epping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Royal Highness will pardon the informality
of your reception,&rdquo; the Prime Minister
said, when the greetings were over; &ldquo;I assumed
you did not want Lotzen to know of your coming;
<span class="pb" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
I even waited until nine o&rsquo;clock to call the Council;&mdash;and
I did not notify him, and so warn him that
we had penetrated his disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo; the Princess asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Ferida Palace&mdash;he went there last night
and has not left it since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I want him at the Council,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;Colonel Moore, will you and Colonel Bernheim
please go and summon him; then follow us at once;
and do you, my dear Count, come to me as soon
as the Ministers have assembled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brougham flashed away, and the Archduke
drew down the blinds.</p>
<p>Dehra gave a satisfied little sigh and sank back
in the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We seem to have beaten him,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;we
shall have the first look into the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armand put his arm around her, and drew the
fair head to his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already beaten him,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;we
fought first, for you, little girl. A fig for the
box, and the Book and the Crown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the gate of the Park the Princess signaled
to halt, and raised the blind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who of the Royal Council have arrived?&rdquo;
she asked the officer on duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Royal Highness the Duke of Lotzen,
General Du&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he got no further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my private entrance! quick, quick!&rdquo; she
called, and the carriage shot away....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_352">[352]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; she demanded; &ldquo;Epping
said Lotzen had not left the Ferida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that you have solved the riddle.
Lotzen has not come to the Council, he does not
even know of it; he has come for the Book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drew up at the door, the Archduke opened
it with Dehra&rsquo;s key, and they dashed up stairs.
She snatched a master-key from a drawer of her
writing table, and they crossed the corridor and
entered the King&rsquo;s suite through the small reception
room, between which and the library lay a
cabinet and a bedroom.</p>
<p>As they entered the latter, treading cautiously,
they heard the Duke of Lotzen&rsquo;s voice in the
library, the door of which stood ajar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity to break it,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
and there was a snap and crack.</p>
<p>Under the Archduke&rsquo;s hand the door opened
noiselessly, and through the narrow rift, between
the hangings, they could see within.</p>
<p>The Duke, no longer disguised but wearing the
undress uniform of his rank, was standing at the
large desk; beside him an officer in a long cape
and a Cuirassier helmet; and before him the big,
black box of the Laws. He had just forced the
lock; now he laid back the lid, and took out the
Book.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_353">[353]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We win, Duchess!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we win! thanks
to your marvellous fingers and quick brain,&rdquo; and
lifting the helmet from Madeline Spencer&rsquo;s high
piled hair, he kissed her ardently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so, cousin!&rdquo; said the Princess, flinging
aside the curtain, &ldquo;you lose&mdash;it is we who win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the Duke stood staring, too
amazed to speak, and Mrs. Spencer, with a sharp
cry, fled to his side; then, as he saw the end of
his dream, the passing of his hopes, the fierce and
fiery spirit, that was always burning deep in his
soul, burst through the gyves of studied equanimity
his stern will had imposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;not yet!&rdquo; and turning
quickly he tossed the Book into the big chimney
behind him where a wood fire burned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he taunted, flashing out his sword,
&ldquo;come on, cousin Armand!&mdash;there&rsquo;s your crown,
come get it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look to the Book, Dehra!&rdquo; the Archduke
called, and sprang at Lotzen, with a joyful smile.
&ldquo;At last!&rdquo; he said, and the fight began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Push the Book farther into the fire, Madeline!&rdquo;
the Duke ordered, the words timed to the beat of
the steel.</p>
<p>Dropping her cape Mrs. Spencer, with the easy
hand of a practiced fencer, whipped out the sword
she was wearing, in her disguise as an officer, and
was speeding to obey, when Dehra caught up
one of Colonel Moore&rsquo;s swords from the corner
and rushed upon her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_354">[354]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guard yourself, Duchess!&rdquo; Lotzen cried; and
she swung around just in time to throw herself
between the Princess and the fireplace. Instantly
their blades rang together.</p>
<p>The Archduke heard, and out of the side of
his eye he saw, and his brow wrinkled in anxiety.
Spencer was no novice; she, too, he knew, had
learned the gentle art of the foils in her youth,
and under French <i>ma&icirc;tres</i>, and she was not to be
despised even by one so skilful as the Regent. He
had little doubt that he could kill the Duke, but
what profit in it if Dehra died. He hesitated to
speak, it might disconcert her, and yet he must
warn her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch her play in tierce,&rdquo; he said, in the most
casual tone; and almost shouted for joy, when he
heard Dehra&rsquo;s little laugh, and her voice calm
and easy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Armand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it very nearly cost him his own life, for in
trying to catch a glimpse of her he had loosed his
eye-grip, and Lotzen&rsquo;s point shot out viciously,
and only a lucky swing aside sent it scraping
along the skin instead of through the neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather close, cousin!&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next will be closer,&rdquo; said the Duke softly.
&ldquo;Meanwhile, the Book burns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Archduke did not fall into the trap,
and loose the eye-grip a second time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it burn!&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather kill
you than save it&mdash;but I will do both.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_355">[355]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you can, cousin! if you can&mdash;&rdquo; and the
swords rang on.</p>
<p>And the Duke was right&mdash;the Book was burning,
slowly, but burning none the less. His throw had
been a trifle short, and instead of being in the
heart of the fire it was on the outer edge, where
the coals were not so glowing. There the leather
and metal cover had protected it for a short while,
but now the tiny flames were crawling along the
edges, shooting up quick pencils of light that flared
ever higher and more frequent.</p>
<p>And Dehra caught the gleam when it flashed
the brightest, and in a fury of desire she drove at
Madeline Spencer. Hitherto she had aimed only
to disarm her, now it was the Book at any price.</p>
<p>But the American woman&rsquo;s defense was still
impenetrable; defence was her forte&mdash;trick, feint,
attack, she knew every one, and always her sword
blocked them or turned them aside. But there
she had stopped; never once had she herself assumed
the offensive. She would take no chance of
killing the Regent; and she had soon discovered
the Regent was not aiming to kill her. But now
she felt the change, and she knew that it was a
matter of only a little while until she would have
to yield or be sped. She could hear Lotzen and
the Archduke, at the other end of the room, still
fighting as fiercely as at the beginning;&mdash;the
taunting laugh; the quip given, and returned; the
crash of a chair as one of them kicked it away;
but all she saw was the flitting steel before her, and
the Princess&rsquo; glowing eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_356">[356]</div>
<p>Of a sudden there came a burst of voices,
the door toward the Council Chamber was dashed
open, and Count Epping rushed in, and all the
Ministers behind him.</p>
<p>Madeline Spencer drew back and lowered her
sword; the Princess sprang to the fire-place and
rescued the Book, smothering the flames with the
hearth rug; but Lotzen ground out an oath and
flung himself with fresh fierceness at the Archduke.</p>
<p>At first even the imperturbable Prime Minister
had been too astonished to act; now he came
slowly forward, his old, lean face aglow with the
joy of the combat and the music of the steel.
Then he stopped and stood, watching, head slightly
forward, lips half parted, eyes shining, fingers
playing lovingly over his own hilt. Ah! it was a
good fight to look upon; a noble fight, indeed;
such masterly sword play he had never seen, nor
was ever like to see again; the swift attacks, the
fierce rallies, the marvellous agility, the steady eye,
the steel wrist. And then, the nerve of him who
was losing, and must know it; for Lotzen was
losing&mdash;surely losing. Twice the Archduke had
driven him around the table; now he forced him
slowly back ... back ... back
... to the wall ... against it
... tight against it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_357">[357]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yield, cousin!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s your last
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Duke only smiled mockingly and fought
on.</p>
<p>With an appealing cry Madeline Spencer darted
toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare him, Armand!&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;spare
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke stepped out of distance, but with
point still advanced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take him, and joy with
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ferdinand of Lotzen slowly raised his sword in
salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My thanks, cousin!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can accept
from her what I could not from you. You have
bested me&mdash;the game is over. I shall not be needed
at the reading of the decree.&mdash;Your Royal Highness&mdash;Messieurs
of the Council&mdash;I bid you fare-well.&rdquo;
He held out his hand to Madeline Spencer.
&ldquo;Come, my Duchess, we will to your Paris and
the Rue Royale.&mdash;Monsieur le Comte, the door!&rdquo;&mdash;and
with all the stately grace and courteous
deference of a minuet he led her down the room,
and bowed her out, and himself after.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence; then the Archduke
spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_358">[358]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My lords, the Book of Laws is found, or so
much of it as the fire has spared. How we chanced
to come upon it here will best be told another
time; enough now that but for the daring and
quick wit of Her Royal Highness, it would have
been forever lost.&rdquo; He glanced at the clock. &ldquo;The
hour for the Council has already passed. Your
Excellency, the Laws are before you, will you do
us the favor to read the decree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count stepped forward and lifted the Book
from the rug; of the heavy cover little remained
but the brass hinges; the first few pages were
scorched and half consumed, and all the edges
charred and split and eaten into by the flames; but
otherwise it seemed to be without hurt.</p>
<p>Yet Dehra&rsquo;s hand went to her heart, and her
breath came sharply, as slowly and carefully
Epping turned the leaves, holding them together
the while, lest they break apart. Was the decree
there! Might Lotzen have destroyed it&mdash;torn it
from the Book, before they came upon him!</p>
<p>Then the Count stopped, and bending down
read for a moment. When he looked up there was
a strange expression on his face; he did not speak
at once; and when he did his voice was repressed
and almost trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is here,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;executed the day before
King Frederick died. I read it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Section one hundred thirty-first.&mdash;It is hereby
decreed that His Royal Highness the Archduke Armand
shall be eligible to the Crown of Valeria, and
he is herewith restored to his proper place in the Line
of Succession, as the right heir male of Hugo, second
son of Henry the Third.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_359">[359]</div>
<p>For an instant Armand&rsquo;s brain whirled&mdash;then
he awoke to Dehra&rsquo;s hands in his, and her voice
in his ear, and the shouts and waving blades of the
Ministers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ritual, Epping! the ritual!&rdquo; the Princess
cried, and caught up the sword she had tossed
aside to rescue the Book&mdash;then gasped in wondering
fear, as the old Count raised his hand and
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there is another decree that
comes before the ritual. Attend!&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Section one hundred thirty-second.&mdash;Whereas, for
the first time in a thousand years the Dalberg has no
son: It is hereby decreed that the succession as Head
of the House of Dalberg, and, ipso facto, to the Crown
of Valeria, together with all their hereditary titles,
powers, possessions and privileges, shall be vested in
our only child and daughter, Dehra, Princess Royal of
Valeria. And all and every decree conflicting therewith
is hereby specifically revoked and annulled.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now the swords were up again, and the
Archduke&rsquo;s with them, and the wild huzza roared
through the Palace and far into the Park; and
Bernheim and Moore, coming down the corridor,
dashed into the library and stopped, amazed; then
joined in, knowing that it must mean victory.</p>
<p>But Dehra, herself, pale-faced, tear-eyed and
trembling, turned and flung her arms around
Armand&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_360">[360]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wrong, dear! it&rsquo;s wrong!&rdquo; she cried;
&ldquo;you are the King!&mdash;you are the Dalberg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sweetheart, it is right!&rdquo; he said, releasing
her arms, and bowing over her hand until his lips
touched it. &ldquo;Praise God! it is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he stepped back and flashed his sword above
her head; and all the others sprang to meet it,
and locked there, a canopy of steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valeria hails the Head of the House of Dalberg
as the Queen!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>And from every throat came back the answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hail the Dalberg Queen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now the trembling had passed; she looked
up at the swords proudly, and stretching out her
hand she touched them one by one; but touching
Armand&rsquo;s last&mdash;and her eyes sought his, and over
her face broke the adorable smile, and she drew
down his blade, and kissed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hail, also, to the King!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;your
King and mine, my lords!&mdash;the King that is to
be.&rdquo;</p>

Strangely enough, Dalberg proves to be of the blood

<p>This period of the great French Revolution appeals
to the imagination in a way that no other historic
event does. It was so very terrible and yet so
very recent. The Baroness Orczy&rsquo;s story deals with
the most stirring moment of that exciting time&mdash;when
the &ldquo;Law of the Suspect&rdquo; was in full force, which
gave every French man or woman the right to denounce
a fellow man or woman to that awful tribunal of the
Revolution which knew neither mercy nor justice. The
romance of &ldquo;I Will Repay&rdquo; is concerned with the
tragedy of a soul-conflict &rsquo;twixt love and a mistaken
sense of duty. The Scarlet Pimpernel, of her former
book of this title, plays an important part in the development
of the story of &ldquo;I Will Repay.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="c28">The Affair at Pine Court</h3>
<p class="center">By NELSON RUST GILBERT</p>
<p>A truly American novel of love and mystery, taking
place at the Adirondack lodge of a New York
millionaire. It is a story of living people set against
a background of October-painted forests, azure lakes,
and limpid trout-streams.</p>
<p>The reader lives through such exciting days in the
depths of this great forest, with characters so well
drawn and so intensely human as to seem alive. The
arrival of a German count gives direction and impetus
to incipient love affairs. He arouses the greed of
the humble natives by exhibiting the wonderful
&ldquo;Lens of the Gau&rdquo; in the presence of his host&rsquo;s
butler. These envious enemies of the rich pleasure-seekers
at the court put the house in a stage of siege,
during which each guest displays his or her real character.
The many incidents of the forest war are told
with admirable skill, and a happily ending love affair
keeps the reader&rsquo;s attention taut and eager.</p>

<p class="center">By WILLIAM WALLACE WHITELOCK</p>
<p class="center"><span class="small"><i>Author of &ldquo;The Literary Guillotine,&rdquo; etc.</i></span></p>
<p>A small German principality is the seat of
exciting warfare. An unscrupulous king and a conniving
&ldquo;minister of interior improvements&rdquo; find
their match in two invincible Americans who keep
the secret of a young prince&rsquo;s hiding-place, and with
characteristic American energy join in a revolutionary
plot to unseat the reigning monarch and place the
prince upon the throne.</p>

<p>This is not, as the title might suggest, a tale of
daring deeds on the deep, but a blithesome story of the
adventures of three American girls while spending
their summer vacation on a Canadian island. They
become involved in a series of strange happenings by
a band of clever smugglers who pose as their friends,
using them as a blind in their smuggling operations.
There is a pretty love story interwoven with mystery,
adventure, and humor, that holds the reader&rsquo;s interest
from cover to cover.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
